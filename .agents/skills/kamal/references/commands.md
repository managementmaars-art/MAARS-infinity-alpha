## Core Deployment Commands

### kamal init
Initialize Kamal configuration in a project.

```bash
kamal init
```

**What it does:**
- Creates `config/deploy.yml` with basic configuration template
- Creates `.kamal/secrets` template for environment variables

### kamal setup
Initial provisioning and first deploy.

```bash
kamal setup [OPTIONS]
```

**What it does:**
1. Ensures `.kamal` directory exists on hosts
2. Runs `kamal server bootstrap` (installs Docker if needed)
3. Creates Docker network
4. Starts Kamal Proxy
5. Boots accessories
6. Builds and pushes application image
7. Deploys application containers

**Options:**
- `-d, --destination=DESTINATION`: Target specific environment (e.g., staging)
- `-p, --primary`: Run only on primary host
- `-h, --hosts=HOSTS`: Run on specific hosts (comma-separated)
- `-r, --roles=ROLES`: Run on specific roles (comma-separated)
- `-c, --config-file=FILE`: Use specific config file

### kamal deploy

```

**What it does:**
1. Builds and pushes new image (unless `--skip-push`)
2. Ensures proxy is running

# Deploy without building (use existing image)
kamal deploy --skip-push
```

### kamal redeploy
Redeploy without proxy setup (faster for development).

```bash
kamal redeploy [OPTIONS]
```

## Hook Integration

Kamal runs hooks at key lifecycle points. Create scripts in `.kamal/hooks/`:

- `pre-connect`: Before SSH connection
- `pre-build`: Before building image  
- `pre-deploy`: Before deploying
- `post-deploy`: After successful deploy
- `post-proxy-reboot`: After proxy restarts
- `docker-setup`: During Docker installation

**Example `.kamal/hooks/pre-deploy`:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running pre-deploy checks..."
kamal app exec -p "bin/rails db:migrate:status"
```

Make hooks executable: `chmod +x .kamal/hooks/*`

Disable hooks: `kamal deploy --skip-hooks`
