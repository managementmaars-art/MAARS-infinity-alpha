description: >-
  Autonomous build-phase orchestrator with 8-stage per-slice pipeline
  (decompose, slice readiness review, implement via TDD pairs, three-stage
  code review, address feedback, mutation testing, push/CI, merge/flag).
  Manages slice queue (walking skeleton first, dependency ordering), dispatches
  TDD pairs with capability detection, enforces 5 binary quality gates with
  3-cycle rework budgets and human escalation, maintains audit trail, and
  respects strict controller boundaries (never writes code, delegates all
  creative work). Supports three autonomy levels (conservative/standard/full).
  Use when running factory mode, orchestrating build phases, managing slice
  queues, or coordinating TDD pairs with review gates. Triggers on: "run the
  pipeline", "factory mode", "build phase", "slice queue", "quality gates",
  "autonomous build". NOT for: individual TDD (use tdd), standalone code
  reviews (use code-review), CI-only workflows (use ci-integration).

# Pipeline

**Value:** Flow -- continuous, gated progression from slice to shipped code
eliminates idle coordination overhead and makes quality evidence accumulate
automatically.

## Purpose

Orchestrates the build phase end-to-end: takes vertical slices from the queue,
dispatches TDD pairs, runs full-team code review before push, enforces mutation
testing and CI gates, and merges or escalates. The pipeline controller handles
all operational tasks (running tests, pushing code, managing git) so team member
agents focus exclusively on creative work.

## Practices

### Slice Queue Management

The pipeline reads vertical slices from event model output and maintains their
state in `.factory/slice-queue.json`. See `references/slice-queue.md` for the
full queue schema and operations.

Each slice carries a `context` block with enriched metadata for downstream
pipeline stages: `acceptance_scenarios` (full-stack GWT scenarios exercising
the application boundary, human-owned) and `domain_scenarios` (event-model
unit scenarios for commands and projections), an event model source path (so
the TDD pair can consult the original model), related slice IDs for cross-slice
dependency tracking, domain types referenced by the slice (enabling
pre-implementation type discovery), and UI components referenced (triggering
conditional context gathering when the slice touches the interface layer). See
`references/slice-queue.md` for the full two-tier scenario schema.

**Vertical slice integrity:** Every slice MUST deliver behavior through a
user-facing boundary (UI for a human) or an external-API boundary (for
third-party software consumers). Internal APIs that serve the application's
own front-end are NOT external — slices touching them still require UI
acceptance tests. There are no "domain-only," "infrastructure-only," or
"backend-only" slices — infrastructure exists to serve functionality. If a
slice does not include a user-facing or external-API boundary, it is not a
vertical slice and MUST NOT enter the queue. Any rare deviation (e.g.,
backend restructuring with no net-new acceptance tests) requires explicit
human approval before the slice enters the queue.

**Ordering strategy:** Walking skeleton first (the thinnest end-to-end path),
then by dependency graph (slices whose predecessors are complete), then by
priority. The first slice in any project must always be a walking skeleton.

**Slice states:** pending, active, blocked, completed, escalated. Only one
slice may be active at a time unless running at full autonomy level, where
parallel slices operate in isolated git worktrees (one worktree per active
slice at `.factory/worktrees/<slice-id>`). See `references/autonomy-levels.md`.

### Per-Slice Pipeline

Each slice flows through a fixed sequence of stages. Every stage has a binary
quality gate. A gate failure routes back for rework; it never skips forward.

1. **Decompose** -- Invoke `task-management` to break the slice into leaf
   tasks with acceptance criteria. Output: task tree in
   `.factory/audit-trail/slices/<slice-id>/decomposition.json`.

2. **Slice Readiness Review** (full ensemble, before first TDD cycle)
   - Convene the full ensemble using subagent spawning
   - Produce an approved Slice Plan document including the Agent Delivery Contract
     (see `references/slice-readiness-review.md` and `references/agent-delivery-contract.md`)
   - Gate: the build trio does NOT start until the plan is approved (all members,
     zero open items, human sign-off on Contract Tiers 1–3, zero active-slice
     domain type or bounded context conflicts)
   - Create Tasks from the plan's Task Breakdown section with `blockedBy` encoding
     component pre-work dependencies

3. **Implement** -- **TDD skill invocation gate (BLOCKING):** Before
   dispatching any TDD work, invoke the `tdd` skill. The TDD skill detects
   harness capabilities and loads the appropriate strategy entry-point
   (orchestrator.md for subagent strategy, chaining rules for chaining
   strategy). The pipeline MUST NOT dispatch TDD phases until the TDD skill's
   orchestration rules are loaded — without them, the pipeline lacks scenario
   boundary classification, outside-in progression enforcement, and
   drill-down rules. This is not optional prose; it is a prerequisite gate.

   Before dispatching the TDD pair, the pipeline gathers
   pre-implementation context scoped to what TDD needs: Contract Tiers 2–3
   (acceptance scenarios and feature constraints), existing domain types
   matching the slice's referenced types, and event model context. If the
   slice touches UI, design system components are included. Do NOT pass full
   conversation history or all contract tiers — see `references/tokenomics.md`
   for per-phase context scoping rules.

   **TDD dispatch (the pipeline controller IS the orchestrator):**
   The pipeline controller performs capability detection (per TDD skill's
   hierarchy) and dispatches directly. Do NOT spawn a single "orchestrator"
   subagent -- that hides work and bypasses strategy detection.

   - **Agent tool available:** The pipeline controller acts as the
     orchestrator per `tdd/references/orchestrator.md`, spawning
     per-phase subagents using `Agent(subagent_type="<agent-name>",
     prompt="...")` with fresh context each time. When `.claude/agents/`
     definitions exist, named personas are used for ping and pong roles
     per `tdd/references/ping-pong-pairing.md`. The orchestrator collects
     results from each subagent and passes them as context to the next.
   - **Neither available:** The pipeline controller runs chaining mode,
     playing each TDD role sequentially per the TDD skill's chaining
     section.

   The TDD pair then works through red-green-domain-commit cycles without
   consensus rounds. No team discussion during implementation. Output: passing
   tests, committed code, cycle evidence in
   `.factory/audit-trail/slices/<slice-id>/tdd-cycles/`.

4. **Review** -- Before pushing, invoke `code-review` with the full team for
   three-stage mob review (spec compliance, code quality, domain integrity).
   All review findings must be addressed before proceeding. See
   `references/gate-definitions.md` for review gate criteria.

5. **Address feedback** -- Route review findings back to the TDD pair. The
   pair fixes via their existing ping-pong process. Re-review scoped to
   flagged concerns only (unless critical-category feedback).

6. **Mutation test** -- Invoke `mutation-testing` scoped to changed files.
   Required: 100% kill rate. Survivors route back to the TDD pair.

7. **Push and CI** -- Pipeline pushes the branch and waits for CI. On infra
   failures at standard or full autonomy, auto-retry once. On test failures,
   route to triage.

8. **Merge or flag** -- If all gates pass, merge (auto at full autonomy,
   manual otherwise). If any gate failed after exhausting rework budget,
   escalate to human.

### Quality Gates

Five binary gates. Each requires structured evidence. See
`references/gate-definitions.md` for full criteria, evidence schemas, and
failure routing.

| Gate | Pass Criteria | Failure Route |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| TDD | Acceptance scenario test passes (boundary-level), all units pass, domain review approved | Back to tdd pair |
| Review | All three stages PASS | Back to tdd pair with findings |
| Mutation | 100% kill rate on changed files | Back to tdd pair with survivors |
| CI | Pipeline green | ci-integration triage |
| Merge | All upstream gates pass, no blocking escalations, branch current | Rebase and re-gate |

### Rework Protocol

Gate failures route back to the appropriate skill. Each gate allows a maximum
of 3 rework cycles per slice. After 3 failures at the same gate, the pipeline
halts the slice, compiles full context (all attempts, all evidence), and
escalates to the human. See `references/rework-protocol.md` for routing rules
and tracking schema.

### Progressive Autonomy

The pipeline operates at one of three autonomy levels configured in
`.factory/config.yaml`. See `references/autonomy-levels.md` for full details.

- **Conservative:** All gates enforced, no auto-merge, human notified of every
  gate result, human approves every merge.
- **Standard:** Auto-rework within budget, batch non-blocking findings, skip
  trivial review items, auto-retry CI on infra failures.
- **Full:** Auto-merge when all gates pass, parallel slice execution using
  git worktree isolation (each active slice gets its own worktree; conflicts
  are detected at merge time), pair selection and slice ordering optimization.
  If `git worktree` is not available, the pipeline falls back to sequential
  execution and logs a warning.

### Pipeline Operates Directly

Unlike the ensemble-team coordinator (which delegates everything), the pipeline
controller directly executes operational tasks: running test suites, invoking
mutation tools, pushing branches, checking CI status, managing git operations,
updating queue state. Team member agents are invoked only for creative work:
writing tests, writing code, conducting reviews.

### Controller Role Boundaries

The pipeline controller is an orchestrator, not a developer. Respect these
boundaries absolutely.

**The controller MAY:**
- Run test suites, mutation tools, and CI checks
- Execute git operations (commit, push, rebase, merge)
- Read files for context gathering
- Manage queue state and audit trail
- Spawn and coordinate agents
- Route rework findings back to the appropriate agent

**The controller MUST NOT:**
- Write or edit test files
- Write or edit production code
- Write or edit type definitions
- Write or edit documentation content
- Make design decisions
- Conduct code reviews
- Fix failing tests
- Refactor code
- Start TDD cycles on a slice without an approved Slice Plan
- Allow the build trio to discover missing UI components or undefined domain types
  mid-cycle — these are identified in the Slice Readiness Review

If you catch yourself about to write code — even "just one line" — stop
and delegate. The temptation is strongest when a fix seems trivial, but
trivial fixes bypass review and accumulate into unreviewed code.

### Per-Slice Gate Task Tracking

At the start of every slice, create a gate checklist at
`.factory/audit-trail/slices/<slice-id>/gates.md`:

```markdown
# Gate Checklist: [slice-id]

- [ ] Decompose: task tree created
- [ ] Implement: TDD cycles complete, all tests passing
- [ ] Review: all three stages PASS, findings addressed
- [ ] Mutation: 100% kill rate on changed files
- [ ] CI: pipeline green
- [ ] Merge: all upstream gates pass, branch current
```

Update each item as the gate completes. After crash or context compaction,
read this checklist to determine the resume point — do not guess from
memory.

### Session Resilience

Long pipeline runs are vulnerable to context compaction and crashes.

**Self-reminder protocol:** See `CONSTRAINT-RESOLUTION.md` in the template
directory for the consolidated self-reminder protocol (frequency, combined
re-read list, and post-compaction rules).

**Crash recovery:** See `references/crash-recovery.md` for the full
recovery procedure. Key principle: read persistent state, do not
reconstruct from memory.

### What You Are NOT

You are NOT a developer. You are NOT a reviewer. You are NOT an architect.
You are NOT the team. You are the pipeline controller — you manage flow,
enforce gates, and delegate creative work. If you find yourself writing
code, conducting a review, or making a design decision, stop. Delegate.

### Audit Trail

Every pipeline action produces structured evidence in `.factory/audit-trail/`.
See `references/audit-trail-schema.md` for the directory layout and JSON
schemas. The audit trail enables retrospectives, trend analysis, and
reproducible escalation context. Every agent-generated commit includes a
provenance footer (`Slice: <id> | Scenario: <id>`) appended by the pipeline
controller; TDD cycle records include a `provenance` block with agent roles,
skill version, and scenario ID.

## Enforcement Note

Gating in all modes. The pipeline provides gating enforcement: no stage
proceeds without meeting gate criteria. Gate failures route to rework,
never bypass. This prevents low-quality work from reaching the main branch.
It cannot prevent low-quality work from being written -- that depends on
the advisory/structural enforcement of the skills invoked during each phase.

**Hard constraints:**
- Gate failures route to rework, never skip: `[H]`
- Rework budget exhausted (3 cycles): `[RP]` -- escalate, do not force a
  4th cycle
- Walking skeleton first: `[H]` -- first slice in any project must be a
  walking skeleton

See `CONSTRAINT-RESOLUTION.md` in the template directory for all known
cross-skill conflicts.

## Constraints

- **Controller role boundaries**: The controller NEVER writes code, tests,
  types, or documentation content. "Operational" tasks like updating gate
  checklists, writing WORKING_STATE.md, and managing audit trail files are
  not "writing code." But writing a "helper script" or "utility function"
  to assist orchestration IS writing code and is forbidden.
- **"No consensus during TDD build"**: This means the TDD pair implements
  without team discussion. It does NOT mean the pair cannot ask clarifying
  questions about the spec. A clarifying question is: "Does the AC mean X
  or Y?" A consensus round is: "Should we use approach A or approach B?"
  The former is allowed; the latter is not.

## Verification

After completing a slice through the pipeline, verify:

- [ ] Slice was decomposed into leaf tasks with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Pre-implementation context was gathered and passed to the orchestrator
- [ ] TDD pair implemented without consensus rounds (no team discussion)
- [ ] Full-team code review occurred before push (all three stages)
- [ ] All review findings were addressed before proceeding
- [ ] Mutation testing achieved 100% kill rate on changed files
- [ ] CI pipeline passed green
- [ ] Merge occurred only after all five gates passed
- [ ] Audit trail entries exist for every stage
- [ ] Acceptance test exercises the application boundary
- [ ] Rework cycles (if any) stayed within the 3-cycle budget per gate
- [ ] Controller never wrote code (tests, production, types, or docs)
- [ ] Gate task list maintained for every slice
- [ ] WORKING_STATE.md kept current throughout the run
- [ ] State re-read after any crash or compaction (not guessed)

## Dependencies

This skill requires other skills to function. It orchestrates them; it does not
replace them.

- **tdd:** Pair implementation engine. The pipeline dispatches TDD pairs and
  collects cycle evidence.
- **code-review:** Three-stage review protocol. The pipeline invokes full-team
  review before every push.
- **mutation-testing:** Quality gate for test effectiveness. The pipeline runs
  mutation testing scoped to changed files.
- **task-management:** Work decomposition. The pipeline decomposes slices into
  leaf tasks before implementation.
- **ci-integration:** CI pipeline monitoring. The pipeline pushes and waits for
  CI results.
