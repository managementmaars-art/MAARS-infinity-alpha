# Audit Trail Schema

Every pipeline action produces structured evidence stored in the `.factory/`
directory. This document defines the directory layout and JSON schemas for
each file type.

## Slice-Level Schemas

### decomposition.json

Produced by the task-management skill at the start of each slice.

```json
{
  "slice_id": "auth-registration",
  "slice_description": "User can register with email and password",
  "created_at": "2026-02-22T10:00:00Z",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "auth-reg-001",
      "name": "Create registration command handler",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Given valid registration data, when command is processed, then UserRegistered event is stored",
        "Given a duplicate email, when command is processed, then command is rejected with a clear error"
      ],
      "dependencies": [],
      "status": "open"
    },
    {
      "task_id": "auth-reg-002",
      "name": "Add email validation domain type",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Email type rejects malformed addresses at construction time",
        "Email type normalizes casing"
      ],
      "dependencies": [],
      "status": "open"
    }
  ],
  "dependency_graph": {
    "auth-reg-001": [],
    "auth-reg-002": []
  }
}
```

### tdd-cycles/cycle-NNN.json

Produced after each completed RED-GREEN-DOMAIN-COMMIT cycle.

```json
{
  "cycle_number": 1,
  "slice_id": "auth-registration",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-22T10:45:00Z",
  "pair": ["engineer-a", "engineer-b"],
  "provenance": {
    "agent_roles": {"ping": "engineer-a", "pong": "engineer-b"},
    "skill_version": "tdd@2.0",
    "scenario": "auth-registration-S1"
  },
  "phases": {
    "red": {
      "test_file": "tests/acceptance/registration_test.ext",
      "test_name": "test_valid_registration_stores_event",
      "failure_output": "Error: function register_user not found",
      "files_changed": ["tests/acceptance/registration_test.ext"]
    },
    "domain_after_red": {
      "verdict": "APPROVED",
      "types_created": ["src/auth/types.ext"],
      "concerns": []
    },
    "green": {
      "implementation_files": ["src/auth/handler.ext"],
      "test_output": "1 test passed, 0 failed",
      "files_changed": ["src/auth/handler.ext"]
    },
    "domain_after_green": {
      "verdict": "APPROVED",
      "review_notes": "Types are clean, validation at construction",
      "full_test_output": "1 test passed, 0 failed"
    },
    "commit": {
      "commit_hash": "abc1234",
      "commit_message": "feat(auth): registration handler stores UserRegistered event\n\nSlice: auth-registration | Scenario: auth-registration-S1",
      "full_test_output": "1 test passed, 0 failed"
    }
  }
}
```

**Commit message footer format:** Every agent-generated commit must include a
footer appended by the pipeline controller:
```
Slice: <slice-id> | Scenario: <scenario-id>
```
This enables tracing any commit back to the originating slice and scenario,
supporting the agent change failure rate metric and post-failure root cause
analysis.

**Provenance fields:**
- `agent_roles`: maps TDD role (ping/pong) to agent name for that cycle
- `skill_version`: the tdd skill version active during this cycle (e.g. `tdd@2.0`)
- `scenario`: the scenario ID being implemented in this cycle

### review.json

Produced after the full-team code review completes (or after each re-review
during rework).

  "slice_id": "auth-registration",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-22T12:00:00Z",

  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Add a pre-review checklist item for boundary test coverage"
  ],
  "requires_human_approval": true
}
```

## File Lifecycle Rules

- **Append-only within a slice:** Rework attempts produce new entries, not
  overwrites. The full history is preserved.
- **Immutable after slice completion:** Once `outcome.json` is written, no
  slice files are modified.
- **Queue state is mutable:** `slice-queue.json` is updated as slices move
  through states.
- **Metrics are regenerated:** Daily summary and trend files are recomputed,
  not appended to.
