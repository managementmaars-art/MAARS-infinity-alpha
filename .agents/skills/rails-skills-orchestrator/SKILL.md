# Rails Skills Orchestrator

Routes to the correct specialized skill for any Ruby on Rails task and enforces the Tests Gate Implementation mandate across all code-producing work.

When a task arrives, identify the matching skill from the tables below and **name it explicitly as the next skill to use** before responding further. Generated artifacts (YARD docs, Postman collections, READMEs) must be in **English** unless the user explicitly requests another language.

## CROSS-CUTTING MANDATE: Tests Gate Implementation

Non-negotiable across every code-producing skill. Workflow: **PRD → TASKS → TESTS → IMPLEMENTATION → YARD → DOCS → CODE REVIEW → PR**. No implementation code until the test exists, has been run, and fails for the right reason.

**Gate cycle per behavior:**

1. Write test → `bundle exec rspec path/to/spec` → confirm failure reason is *feature missing*, not a config or syntax error
2. **CHECKPOINT — Test Feedback:** verify right behavior, right boundary, edge cases covered — only proceed once confirmed
3. **CHECKPOINT — Implementation Proposal:** name classes/methods to create or modify, state data flow, wait for explicit approval
4. Write minimal implementation → `bundle exec rspec path/to/spec` → confirm green; full suite → confirm no regressions
5. Refactor — tests stay green → repeat from step 1 for next behavior

**After all behaviors pass:** GATE — `bundle exec rubocop && bundle exec rspec` → YARD docs → README/diagrams → `rails-code-review` self-review → PR → `rails-review-response` on feedback

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply: TDD → Planning → Domain discovery → Process (refactor-safely) → Domain implementation (rails-\*, ruby-\*). Use rails-tdd-slices when the first failing spec is not obvious.

## Typical Workflows

Sub-skills are invoked by stating their name as the next skill to apply, e.g. *"Next skill: rails-tdd-slices"*, before proceeding with that skill's instructions.

**TDD Feature Loop** *(primary daily workflow)*:
rails-tdd-slices → **[Test Feedback checkpoint]** → **[Implementation Proposal checkpoint]** → implement → **[Linters + Suite gate]** → yard-documentation → rails-code-review → rails-review-response (on feedback) → PR

**Feature (standard):** create-prd → generate-tasks → *TDD Feature Loop*

**Feature (DDD-first):** create-prd → ddd-ubiquitous-language → ddd-boundaries-review → ddd-rails-modeling → generate-tasks → *TDD Feature Loop*

**Code review + response:** rails-code-review → rails-review-response (on feedback) → re-review if Critical items addressed

**Bug fix:** rails-bug-triage → rails-tdd-slices → **[GATE: reproduction spec fails]** → fix → verify passes

**New engine:** rails-engine-author → **[GATE: engine specs fail]** → implement → rails-engine-docs

**Refactoring:** refactor-safely → **[GATE: characterization tests pass on current code]** → refactor → verify still pass

**GraphQL:** ddd-ubiquitous-language → rails-graphql-best-practices → *TDD Feature Loop* → rails-security-review
