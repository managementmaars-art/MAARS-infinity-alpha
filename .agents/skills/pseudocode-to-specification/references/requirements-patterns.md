# Requirements Patterns

This document describes common **business and functional patterns** to recognize in pseudocode and how to extract corresponding functional requirements. These patterns focus on WHAT the system does from a business perspective, excluding implementation, design, and performance details.

## Pattern Recognition Guide

## 1. CRUD Operations Pattern

**Pseudocode Indicators:**

```
create/insert/add
read/get/fetch/retrieve
update/modify/change
delete/remove
```

**Extract:**

- **Business Validation Rules:** Business constraints on input data
- **Business Access Rules:** Who can perform which business operations
- **Business Audit:** What business events need tracking

**Requirements Template:**

```

```

### 2. Validation Pattern

**Pseudocode Indicators:**

```

### 4. Workflow/Pipeline Pattern

## Usage Guide

**When analyzing pseudocode:**

1. **Identify Business Pattern:** Match code structure to business patterns above
2. **Extract Business Elements:** Pull out business-specific components
3. **Generate Functional Requirements:** Use appropriate template focused on business logic
4. **Add Business Context:** Include business rules and constraints
5. **Validate Completeness:** Ensure all business logic paths covered

**Focus on Business Functionality:**

- Describe WHAT from business perspective, not HOW from technical perspective
- Extract business rules, not implementation strategies
- Document business behavior, not performance characteristics
- Specify business constraints, not technical optimizations

**For Multiple Patterns:**

- Code often contains multiple business patterns
- Extract functional requirements for each pattern
- Link related business requirements
- Create hierarchy (business process contains business rules contains business validation)

**Pattern Combinations:**

- Workflow + CRUD + Validation (common for business processes)
- Event + State Machine (common for business event systems)
- Authentication + Authorization + CRUD (common for business APIs)
