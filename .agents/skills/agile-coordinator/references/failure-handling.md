# Failure Handling

How the coordinator handles various failure scenarios.

## Failure Categories

### 1. Worker Implementation Failure

**Cause**: Tests fail, build fails, or worker encounters error during implementation.

**Detection**:
- Worker progress file shows `status: failed`
- Worker progress file shows `error: "..."` field

**Recovery Options**:

| Option | When to Use | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Retry | Transient failure, may succeed on retry | Spawn new worker for same task |
| Skip | Task blocked, other tasks can proceed | Mark task as skipped, continue |
| Abort | Critical failure, unsafe to continue | Stop all workers, cleanup |

**Retry Limits**: Max 2 retries per task before requiring human intervention.

### 2. Test Failure

**Cause**: Tests fail during worker implementation phase.

**Detection**:
- Worker logs show test failures
- `npm test` exits with non-zero code

**Recovery**:
- Worker should attempt to fix (up to 2 attempts)
- If worker cannot fix, mark as failed
- Coordinator offers retry with fresh context or skip

**Example Worker Retry**:
```
Attempt 1: 3 tests failing
Worker fixes test assertions
Attempt 2: 1 test still failing
Worker investigates root cause
Attempt 3: All tests pass
```

### 3. Build/Test Failure in Review

**Cause**: Tests or build fail after implementation complete.

**Detection**:
- Test suite fails during review phase
- Build fails during validation

**Recovery**:
- Worker should return to implementation phase
- Fix the issue, run tests locally
- Re-run review when tests pass
- If repeated failures, mark as failed

### 4. Merge Conflict

**Cause**: Branch cannot merge due to conflicts with main.

**Detection**:
- `git merge` fails with conflict markers
- `git merge --squash` fails with conflict error

**Recovery Options**:

| Option | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Auto-resolve | Rebase feature branch onto main, resolve simple conflicts |
| Manual | Pause for human intervention |
| Skip | Skip this branch, may break subsequent merges |

See [merge-coordination.md](merge-coordination.md) for details.

### 5. Verification Failure

**Cause**: Tests fail after all PRs merged.

**Detection**:
- `npm test` fails in verification phase
- Build fails in verification phase

**Severity**: HIGH - merged code may have regressions.

**Recovery Options**:

| Option | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Investigate | Spawn agent to debug the failures |
| Revert last | Revert the most recent merge |
| Revert all | Revert all merges from this session |
| Manual | Exit for manual investigation |

### 6. Infrastructure Failure

**Cause**: Git unavailable, network issues, disk full, etc.

**Detection**:
- Git commands fail with connection errors
- File system operations fail

**Recovery**:
- Retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Max 3 retries before failing
- Preserve state for resume

```

## Graceful Degradation

### Principle

When failures occur, preserve as much progress as possible.

### Rules

1. **Complete what you can**: If one task fails, other independent tasks can continue
2. **Never leave orphans**: Clean up branches, worktrees on abort
3. **Preserve state**: Always save state before stopping
4. **Clear communication**: Tell user exactly what happened and options

### Example: Partial Completion

```
Tasks: TASK-006, TASK-007, TASK-008

TASK-006: Completed, merged
TASK-007: Failed (tests not passing)
TASK-008: Not started

Coordinator response:
"TASK-006 completed successfully.
TASK-007 failed: 3 tests not passing.

Options:
[retry TASK-007] - Try again with fresh context
[skip to TASK-008] - Continue with remaining tasks
[stop] - Stop here (TASK-006 remains merged)"
```
