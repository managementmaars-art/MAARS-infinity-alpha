## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Collect application specifications:

```
- Application type (web app, mobile backend, data pipeline, SaaS)
- Expected users and requests per second
- Budget constraints (monthly spend limit)
- Team size and AWS experience level
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)
- Availability requirements (SLA, RPO/RTO)
```

### Step 2: Design Architecture

Run the architecture designer to get pattern recommendations:

```bash
python scripts/architecture_designer.py --input requirements.json
```

Select from recommended patterns:
- **Serverless Web**: S3 + CloudFront + API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB
- **Event-Driven Microservices**: EventBridge + Lambda + SQS + Step Functions
- **Three-Tier**: ALB + ECS Fargate + Aurora + ElastiCache
- **GraphQL Backend**: AppSync + Lambda + DynamoDB + Cognito

See `references/architecture_patterns.md` for detailed pattern specifications.

### Step 3: Generate IaC Templates

Create infrastructure-as-code for the selected pattern:

```bash
# Serverless stack (CloudFormation)
python scripts/serverless_stack.py --app-name my-app --region us-east-1

# Output: CloudFormation YAML template ready to deploy
```

### Step 4: Review Costs

Analyze estimated costs and optimization opportunities:

```bash
python scripts/cost_optimizer.py --resources current_setup.json --monthly-spend 2000
```

Output includes:
- Monthly cost breakdown by service
- Right-sizing recommendations
- Savings Plans opportunities
- Potential monthly savings

### Step 5: Deploy

Deploy the generated infrastructure:

```bash
# CloudFormation
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name my-app-stack \
  --template-body file://template.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

# CDK
cdk deploy

# Terraform
terraform init && terraform apply
```

### Step 6: Validate

Verify deployment and set up monitoring:

```bash
# Check stack status
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name my-app-stack

# Set up CloudWatch alarms
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name high-errors ...
```

---

## Tools

### architecture_designer.py

Generates architecture patterns based on requirements.

```bash
python scripts/architecture_designer.py --input requirements.json --output design.json
```

**Input:** JSON with app type, scale, budget, compliance needs
**Output:** Recommended pattern, service stack, cost estimate, pros/cons

### serverless_stack.py

Creates serverless CloudFormation templates.

```bash
python scripts/serverless_stack.py --app-name my-app --region us-east-1
```

**Output:** Production-ready CloudFormation YAML with:
- API Gateway + Lambda
- DynamoDB table
- Cognito user pool
- IAM roles with least privilege
- CloudWatch logging

### cost_optimizer.py

Analyzes costs and recommends optimizations.

```bash
python scripts/cost_optimizer.py --resources inventory.json --monthly-spend 5000
```

**Output:** Recommendations for:
- Idle resource removal
- Instance right-sizing
- Reserved capacity purchases
- Storage tier transitions
- NAT Gateway alternatives

---

## Quick Start

### MVP Architecture (< $100/month)

```
Ask: "Design a serverless MVP backend for a mobile app with 1000 users"

Result:
- Lambda + API Gateway for API
- DynamoDB pay-per-request for data
- Cognito for authentication
- S3 + CloudFront for static assets
- Estimated: $20-50/month
```

### Scaling Architecture ($500-2000/month)

```
Ask: "Design a scalable architecture for a SaaS platform with 50k users"

Result:
- ECS Fargate for containerized API
- Aurora Serverless for relational data
- ElastiCache for session caching
- CloudFront for CDN
- CodePipeline for CI/CD
- Multi-AZ deployment
```

### Cost Optimization

```
Ask: "Optimize my AWS setup to reduce costs by 30%. Current spend: $3000/month"

Provide: Current resource inventory (EC2, RDS, S3, etc.)

Result:
- Idle resource identification
- Right-sizing recommendations
- Savings Plans analysis
- Storage lifecycle policies
- Target savings: $900/month
```

### IaC Generation

```
Ask: "Generate CloudFormation for a three-tier web app with auto-scaling"

Result:
- VPC with public/private subnets
- ALB with HTTPS
- ECS Fargate with auto-scaling
- Aurora with read replicas
- Security groups and IAM roles
```

## Reference Documentation

| Document | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `references/architecture_patterns.md` | 6 patterns: serverless, microservices, three-tier, data processing, GraphQL, multi-region |
| `references/service_selection.md` | Decision matrices for compute, database, storage, messaging |
| `references/best_practices.md` | Serverless design, cost optimization, security hardening, scalability |

---

## Limitations

- Lambda: 15-minute execution, 10GB memory max
- API Gateway: 29-second timeout, 10MB payload
- DynamoDB: 400KB item size, eventually consistent by default
- Regional availability varies by service
- Some services have AWS-specific lock-in

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Lambda cold starts exceed 500ms | Function package too large or VPC-attached Lambda without provisioned concurrency | Reduce deployment package size, use Lambda layers, enable provisioned concurrency for latency-sensitive endpoints, or move to Fargate for consistent performance |
| CloudFormation stack stuck in `ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS` | Resource creation failed mid-deploy and rollback also failed (e.g., non-empty S3 bucket) | Check CloudFormation events for the root cause, manually delete the blocking resource, then delete the stack; use `DeletionPolicy: Retain` for stateful resources |
| Monthly AWS bill significantly exceeds estimate | Untagged resources, forgotten dev/staging environments, or NAT Gateway data transfer costs | Enable Cost Explorer, set up AWS Budgets with 50%/80%/100% alerts, run `cost_optimizer.py` against current inventory, and audit resources with missing tags |
| DynamoDB throttling errors (ProvisionedThroughputExceededException) | Read/write capacity insufficient for traffic spikes, or hot partition key | Switch to on-demand billing mode, redesign partition key for even distribution, or enable DynamoDB Auto Scaling with appropriate min/max settings |
| API Gateway returns 504 Gateway Timeout | Backend Lambda or integration exceeds the 29-second API Gateway limit | Optimize Lambda execution time, offload long tasks to Step Functions or SQS, increase Lambda memory (which also increases CPU), or use asynchronous invocation patterns |
| Cross-region replication lag causes stale reads | DynamoDB Global Tables or Aurora Global Database replication latency under heavy write load | Design for eventual consistency, route reads to the write-primary region for strong consistency, or use conflict resolution strategies documented in `references/architecture_patterns.md` |
| IAM permission denied errors after deployment | Least-privilege policies missing required actions, or trust policy not updated for new services | Review CloudTrail logs for denied API calls, add the specific missing actions to the IAM policy, and validate with IAM Policy Simulator before deploying |

---

## Success Criteria

- **Cost accuracy**: Monthly AWS bill stays within 10% of the architecture estimate produced by `cost_optimizer.py`.
- **Availability**: Production workloads meet or exceed the target SLA (99.9% uptime for three-tier, 99.95% for multi-region).
- **Recovery time**: RTO under 4 hours and RPO under 1 hour for all production architectures with disaster recovery configured.
- **Deployment speed**: Infrastructure provisioned from generated IaC templates in under 30 minutes for serverless stacks and under 60 minutes for three-tier stacks.
- **Security posture**: Zero critical findings in AWS Security Hub within 30 days of deployment; all resources encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Scaling response**: Auto-scaling responds to traffic spikes within 2 minutes, handling 10x baseline load without manual intervention.
- **Operational overhead**: Team spends less than 4 hours per week on infrastructure operations after initial deployment.
