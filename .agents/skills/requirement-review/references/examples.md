## Ambiguous Requirements Examples

## Example 1: Performance Requirements

**❌ Poor (Ambiguous)**:

```
REQ-045: The system shall be fast and responsive.
```

**Issues**:

- "Fast" is subjective - what's fast for one user may be slow for another
- "Responsive" is vague - no measurable criteria
- No context - fast for which operations?
- No baseline - how fast is acceptable?

**✅ Good (Clear)**:

```
REQ-045: The system shall respond to user search queries within 2 seconds for 95% of requests under normal load (up to 1,000 concurrent users).

Acceptance Criteria:
- Search results displayed within 2 seconds for 95th percentile
- Search results displayed within 5 seconds for 99th percentile
- Measured with 1,000 concurrent users performing searches
- Measured over 1-hour sustained load test
- Baseline test data: 1 million product records
```

### Example 2: User Interface Requirements

**❌ Poor (Ambiguous)**:

```
REQ-067: The application shall have a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to use.
```

**Issues**:

- "User-friendly", "intuitive", "easy" are subjective
- No measurable success criteria
- Cannot be tested objectively
- Different users have different skill levels

**✅ Good (Clear)**:

```
REQ-067: The application shall enable new users to complete core tasks without training.

Measurable Criteria:
- 80% of first-time users complete account registration within 5 minutes without assistance
- 70% of new users successfully place first order within 10 minutes without help documentation
- Task completion measured via usability testing with 20+ participants
- Users rate perceived ease-of-use ≥ 4.0/5.0 on post-task survey
- Critical workflows have a maximum of 3 steps from start to completion
```

### Example 3: Security Requirements

**❌ Poor (Ambiguous)**:

```
REQ-089: The system shall be secure and protect user data.
```

**Issues**:

- "Secure" is too broad - what aspects of security?
- "Protect" is vague - protect from what threats?
- No specific mechanisms defined
- Not testable as written

**✅ Good (Clear)**:

```
REQ-089: The system shall protect user data through the following security controls:

1. Authentication:
   - Support OAuth 2.0 and SAML 2.0 authentication
   - Enforce password complexity: min 12 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 special character
   - Lock account after 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes
   - Require password change every 90 days

2. Data Protection:
   - Encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.3
   - Encrypt sensitive PII at rest using AES-256
   - Hash passwords using bcrypt with work factor ≥ 12
   - Mask credit card numbers (show last 4 digits only)

3. Audit & Monitoring:
   - Log all authentication attempts (success and failure) with timestamp, username, IP
   - Log all data access for sensitive fields with user ID and timestamp
   - Retain audit logs for 2 years
   - Alert security team on > 10 failed logins from same IP within 5 minutes
```

## Untestable Requirements Examples

### Example 4: Scalability Requirements

**❌ Poor (Untestable)**:

```
REQ-102: The system shall be highly scalable to support future growth.
```

**Issues**:

- "Highly scalable" has no measurable definition
- "Future growth" is undefined - how much growth?
- No clear test pass/fail criteria
- Cannot verify "shall be scalable"

**✅ Good (Testable)**:

```
REQ-102: The system architecture shall support horizontal scaling to handle increased load.

Testable Criteria:
- System scales from 1,000 to 10,000 concurrent users by adding application servers without code changes
- Response time degrades < 10% when load increases from 1,000 to 5,000 concurrent users (with proportional infrastructure)
- Database supports read replicas with < 100ms replication lag
- Stateless application design allows adding/removing servers without session loss
- Load balancer distributes traffic across N application servers with < 5% variance

Verification Method:
- Load testing with JMeter: measure response times at 1K, 5K, 10K concurrent users
- Infrastructure test: add servers and verify auto-scaling triggers
- Database replication lag monitoring over 24-hour period
```

### Example 5: Maintainability Requirements

**❌ Poor (Untestable)**:

```
REQ-115: The application code shall be maintainable and follow best practices.
```

**Issues**:

- "Maintainable" is subjective
- "Best practices" vary by team/organization
- No objective measurement
- Cannot determine pass/fail

- Pass Prettier formatting checks (automated in pre-commit hook)
- All public APIs documented in OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Code review approval required before merge (min 1 approver)

Verification Method:
- Automated: SonarQube analysis on every commit, build fails if thresholds not met
- Automated: ESLint/Prettier checks in CI pipeline
- Manual: Code review checklist includes documentation review
```

## Conflict Examples

### Example 6: Priority Conflicts

**❌ Conflicting Requirements**:

```
REQ-125: Users shall provide a phone number during registration. [Priority: Critical]
REQ-187: Phone number shall be optional to reduce registration friction. [Priority: Critical]
```

**Issues**:

- Direct contradiction: mandatory vs optional
- Both marked Critical priority - cannot both be essential
- Different stakeholders likely have different objectives
- Developers cannot implement both

**✅ Resolved Requirement**:

```
REQ-125: Users shall provide an email address during registration (mandatory).

REQ-125a: Users may optionally provide a phone number during registration for:
- SMS notifications (opt-in)
- Two-factor authentication (opt-in)
- Order status updates via SMS (opt-in)

REQ-125b: System shall send verification email to confirm email address before account activation.

REQ-125c: If user provides phone number, system shall send SMS verification code before enabling SMS features.

Priority: Critical (email), Medium (phone number)
Rationale: Email is critical for account recovery and communication. Phone is value-add for users who want SMS features.
Resolution Date: 2024-01-15
Stakeholders Consulted: Product Owner (Sarah), UX Lead (Mike), Security (Tom)
```

### Example 7: Technical Conflicts

**❌ Conflicting Requirements**:

```
REQ-145: System shall provide real-time synchronization across all devices with < 1 second delay.
REQ-167: System shall work offline and sync changes when connection is restored.
```

**Issues**:

- Real-time sync requires constant connection
- Offline mode means no connectivity
- Conflict in architectural approach
- Need to clarify expected behavior

**✅ Resolved Requirements**:

```
REQ-145: System shall provide near-real-time synchronization when devices are online.

Criteria:
- Changes sync across devices within 5 seconds when all devices have active internet connection
- WebSocket connection maintains sync state
- Users see "Syncing..." indicator during synchronization
- Users see "Synced" confirmation when complete

REQ-167: System shall support offline mode with deferred synchronization.

Criteria:
- Users can view and edit locally cached data when offline
- System queues changes locally while offline
- UI shows "Offline Mode" indicator clearly
- When connection restored, system syncs queued changes automatically
- Conflict resolution: Last Write Wins (LWW) with timestamp, user notified of conflicts
- User can view sync history showing which device made which changes

Priority: REQ-145 (High), REQ-167 (Medium)
Architecture: Event sourcing with local-first approach using CRDTs for conflict-free merges
```

## User Story Examples

### Example 8: User Story with Poor Acceptance Criteria

**❌ Poor User Story**:

```
US-045: As a user, I want to search for products so that I can find what I need.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Search works
- Results are displayed
- User can click on results
```

**Issues**:

- Criteria are vague ("search works" - how?)
- No specific scenarios defined
- No error cases handled
- No performance criteria
- No edge cases

**✅ Good User Story**:

```
US-045: As a customer, I want to search for products by keyword so that I can quickly find items I'm interested in purchasing.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given I am on any page of the website
When I enter "laptop" in the search box and press Enter or click Search
Then I should see a list of products matching "laptop" within 2 seconds

Given I search for "laptop"
When the search completes
Then results should be sorted by relevance (best match first)
And each result shows: product image, title, price, rating, availability
And I see the number of results found (e.g., "1,247 results for 'laptop'")

Given I search for "xyzabc123nonsense"
When no products match my search
Then I see "No results found for 'xyzabc123nonsense'" message
And I see search suggestions or popular categories

Given I search for a product
When I click on a search result
Then I am taken to that product's detail page

Given I am viewing search results
When there are more than 20 results
Then results are paginated (20 per page)
And I can navigate to next/previous pages
And I can see total pages (e.g., "Page 1 of 63")

Given I use the search feature
When I enter SQL injection attempt "'; DROP TABLE products--"
Then system sanitizes input and treats it as a normal search string
And no database errors occur

Non-Functional:
- Search response time: < 2 seconds for 95% of queries
- Search handles up to 1,000 concurrent search requests
- Search indexing updates within 5 minutes of product changes
- Search supports common misspellings (e.g., "labtop" → "laptop")

Definition of Done:
- Code reviewed and approved
- Unit tests: 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests pass
- Performance test: verified < 2s response
- Security test: SQL injection protection verified
- Deployed to staging and validated by PO
```

### Example 9: User Story Following INVEST Principles

**✅ Good User Story (INVEST)**:

```
US-078: As a returning customer, I want to reorder items from my order history with one click so that I can quickly purchase items I buy regularly.

Story Points: 5

Acceptance Criteria:

Given I am logged in and viewing my order history
When I click "Reorder" button on a previous order
Then all items from that order are added to my cart
And I am taken to the cart page
And I see a confirmation message "12 items added to cart"

Given I click "Reorder" on order #12345
When some items are no longer available
Then available items are added to cart
And I see a message listing unavailable items: "Note: 2 items no longer available: [Item A], [Item B]"
And I can proceed with available items

Given I click "Reorder" on order #12345
When my cart already contains items
Then reordered items are added to existing cart items
And cart shows updated total item count

Given I click "Reorder" on order #12345
When items have price changes since original order
Then items are added at current prices
And I see message "Prices may have changed since your original order"

Definition of Done:
- UI button displays on order history page
- Backend API endpoint: POST /api/orders/{orderId}/reorder
- Unit tests cover: available items, unavailable items, price changes
- E2E test: complete reorder workflow
- Analytics event fired: "reorder_clicked"
- Performance: reorder completes in < 1 second

Dependencies:
- Requires completed: US-034 (Order history page)
- Requires: Product availability API

Notes:
- Product team priority: High (top customer request)
- Analytics show 35% of customers reorder within 30 days
- Expected to increase conversion by 8% (based on A/B test)

INVEST Check:
✅ Independent: Can be developed without other stories
✅ Negotiable: Could simplify to "single item" reorder if needed
✅ Valuable: Directly improves customer convenience and conversion
✅ Estimable: Team can estimate at 5 points
✅ Small: Fits in one sprint
✅ Testable: Clear acceptance criteria with specific scenarios
```
