# Status

Use this skill to track delivery progress. It adapts to what the user needs: a quick checkpoint, a period consolidation, or a delivery closure.

Initial context received via slash: $ARGUMENTS

If `$ARGUMENTS` is filled (e.g., initiative name, issue, plan reference, "daily", "report", "close"), use as starting point.
If empty, ask the user what they need: a checkpoint, a consolidation, or a closure.

## Language

Write the artifact in the user's language. If the user communicates in Portuguese, write in Portuguese with correct grammar and accents. If in English, write in English. When in doubt, ask the user which language to use. Templates are in English — translate headers and content to match.

## Objective

- Track real progress against a plan, story, or epic
- Make blockers explicit with impact, owner, and next action
- Consolidate deliveries, deviations, and risks for a period
- Formally close deliveries with verification and handoff
- Maintain traceability with the active plan or issue

## Modes

### Checkpoint (was `/daily`)

Quick status update — progress, blockers, next step. Under 5 minutes.

**When to use:**
- Daily or session-level progress update
- A blocker surfaced and needs to be made explicit
- Mid-task checkpoint

**Process:**
1. Identify the active plan, story, or issue.
2. Record what advanced since the last cycle.
3. Record blockers with impact, owner, and next action.
4. Define the next observable step.

**Where to save:**
- Present inline by default (checkpoints are short)
- If the user asks to save: `planning/<initiative>/status/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### Consolidation (was `/status-report`)

Period or milestone summary — what was completed, deviations, risks, decisions needed.

**When to use:**
- Stakeholders ask "where are we?" on an initiative
- Mid-epic or mid-sprint consolidated view
- Weekly/biweekly status summary
- Before a sprint review, to prepare the status snapshot

**Process:**
1. Define the report scope (period, milestone, initiative).
2. Collect data from checkpoints, plans, epic/stories, and git log.
3. Consolidate: completed, in progress, deviations, risks, decisions needed.
4. Define next steps with owners.

**Where to save:**
- `planning/<initiative>/status/report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Or present inline if it's a short report

### Closure (was `/post-impl`)

Formal delivery closure — plan vs result, verification, remaining risks, handoff.

**When to use:**
- A plan, story, or epic has been completed
- Before moving to the next delivery
- Before a retro, to create an objective record

**Process:**
1. Identify the delivery being closed (plan, story, epic).
2. Compare plan vs result: what was delivered, what remained pending, scope changes.
3. Execute verifications: lint, typecheck, tests, manual validation. Record actual results.
4. Record remaining risks and next steps.
5. Define handoff (who needs to know).

**Where to save:**
- `planning/<initiative>/status/closure-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- If standalone plan: present inline

## How to decide the mode

- **Need a quick checkpoint?** → Checkpoint mode
- **Need to consolidate a period or milestone?** → Consolidation mode
- **Delivery finished and needs to be closed?** → Closure mode
- **Not sure?** Ask the user for context and suggest the appropriate mode.

## Chaining

- Checkpoint: if critical blocker → escalate or adjust the plan. If delivery closing → switch to closure mode.
- Consolidation: if period closed a delivery → suggest closure mode. If sprint ended → suggest `/review` or `/retro`.
- Closure: if next steps become new tasks → suggest `/task`. If cycle ended → suggest `/retro`. If part of an epic → update story status.

## Reference template

Use `~/.agents/templates/status.md` as base.

## Rules

- Every update must reflect real state, not optimistic intention.
- Blockers must have impact, owner, and next action — not just a description.
- Checkpoints must reference the specific plan, story, or issue for traceability.
- Closure mode must always run lint, typecheck, and tests. Don't assume they pass.
- Report actual results, not intention. If lint failed, say it failed.
- Keep it proportional — a checkpoint should take under 5 minutes, a consolidation under 15.

## Relationship with the flow

This skill handles all delivery tracking. For planning, use `/intake`, `/epic`, or `/task`. For ceremonies, use `/planning`, `/review`, or `/retro`.
