# Implementation

Verification-driven coding with tight feedback loops. Distilled from 21,321 tracked operations across 64+ projects, 612 debugging sessions, and 2,476 conversation histories. These are the patterns that consistently ship working code.

**Core insight:** 2-3 edits then verify. 73% of fixes go unverified — that's the #1 quality gap. The difference between a clean session and a debugging spiral is verification cadence.

## The Sequence

Every implementation follows the same macro-sequence, regardless of scale:

```dot
digraph implement {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box];

    "ORIENT" [style=filled, fillcolor="#e8e8ff"];
    "PLAN" [style=filled, fillcolor="#fff8e0"];
    "IMPLEMENT" [style=filled, fillcolor="#ffe8e8"];
    "VERIFY" [style=filled, fillcolor="#e8ffe8"];
    "COMMIT" [style=filled, fillcolor="#e8e8ff"];

    "ORIENT" -> "PLAN";
    "PLAN" -> "IMPLEMENT";
    "IMPLEMENT" -> "VERIFY";
    "VERIFY" -> "IMPLEMENT" [label="fix", style=dashed];
    "VERIFY" -> "COMMIT" [label="pass"];
}
```

**ORIENT** — Read existing code before touching anything. `Grep -> Read -> Read` is the dominant opening. Sessions that read 10+ files before the first edit require fewer fix iterations. Never start with blind changes.

**PLAN** — Scale-dependent (see below). Skip for trivial fixes, write a task list for features, run a research swarm for epics.

**IMPLEMENT** — Work in batches of 2-3 edits, then verify. Follow the dependency chain. Edit existing files 9:1 over creating new ones. Fix errors immediately — don't accumulate them.

**VERIFY** — Typecheck is the primary gate. Run it after every 2-3 edits. Run tests after feature-complete. Run the full suite before commit.

**COMMIT** — Tests are the final gate. Stage specific files only, never `git add -A`. HEREDOC commit messages with conventional commit format.

## Scale Selection

Strategy changes dramatically based on scope. Pick the right weight class:

| Scale                      | Edits   | Strategy                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trivial** (config, typo) | 1-5     | Read -> Edit -> Verify -> Commit                         |
| **Small fix**              | 5-20    | Grep error -> Read -> Fix -> Test -> Commit              |
| **Feature**                | 50-200  | Plan -> Layer-by-layer impl -> Verify per layer          |
| **Subsystem**              | 300-500 | Task planning -> Wave dispatch -> Layer-by-layer         |
| **Epic**                   | 1000+   | Research swarm -> Spec -> Parallel agents -> Integration |

**Skip planning when:** Scope is clear, single-file change, fix describable in one sentence.

**Plan when:** Multiple files, unfamiliar code, uncertain approach.

---

## Dependency Chain

Build things in this order. Validated across fullstack, Rust, and monorepo projects:

```
Types/Models -> Backend Logic -> API Routes -> Frontend Types -> Hooks/Client -> UI Components -> Tests
```

**Fullstack (Python + TypeScript):**

1. Database model + migration
2. Service/business logic layer
3. API routes (FastAPI or tRPC)
4. Frontend API client
5. React hooks wrapping API calls
6. UI components consuming hooks
7. Lint -> typecheck -> test -> commit

**Rust:**

1. Error types (`thiserror` enum with `#[from]`)
2. Type definitions (structs, enums)
3. Core logic (`impl` blocks)
4. Module wiring (`mod.rs` re-exports)
5. `cargo check` -> `cargo clippy` -> `cargo test`

**Key finding:** Database migrations are written AFTER the code that needs them. Frontend drives backend changes as often as the reverse.

## Verification Cadence

The single most impactful practice. Get this right and everything else follows.

| Gate                   | When                       | Speed               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Typecheck**          | After every 2-3 edits      | Fast (primary gate) |
| **Lint (autofix)**     | After implementation batch | Fast                |
| **Tests (specific)**   | After feature complete     | Medium              |
| **Tests (full suite)** | Before commit              | Slow                |
| **Build**              | Before PR/deploy only      | Slowest             |

### The Edit-Verify-Fix Cycle

The sweet spot: **3 changes -> verify -> 1 fix**. This is the most common successful pattern.

The expensive pattern: **2 changes -> typecheck -> 15 fixes** (type cascade). Prevent by grepping all consumers before modifying shared types.

**Combined gates save time:** `turbo lint:fix typecheck --filter=pkg` runs both in one shot. Scope verification to affected packages, never the full monorepo.

**Practical tips:**

- Run `lint:fix` BEFORE `lint` check to reduce iterations
- `cargo check` over `cargo build` (2-3x faster, same error detection)
- Truncate verbose output: `2>&1 | tail -20`
- Wrap tests with timeout: `timeout 120 uv run pytest`

## Decision Trees

### Read vs Edit

```
Familiar file you edited this session?
  Yes -> Edit directly (verify after)
  No  -> Read it this session?
    Yes -> Edit
    No  -> Read first (79% of quick fixes start with reading)
```

### Subagents vs Direct Work

```
Self-contained with a clear deliverable?
  Yes -> Produces verbose output (tests, logs, research)?
    Yes -> Subagent (keeps context clean)
    No  -> Need frequent back-and-forth?
      Yes -> Direct
      No  -> Subagent
  No -> Direct (iterative refinement needs shared context)
```

### Refactoring Approach

```
Can changes be made incrementally?
  Yes -> Move first, THEN consolidate (separate commits)
        New code alongside old, remove old only after tests pass
  No  -> Analysis phase first (parallel review agents)
        Gap analysis: old vs new function-by-function
        Implement gaps as focused tasks
```

### Bug Fix vs Feature vs Refactor

| Type         | Cadence                                                                  | Typical Cycles |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Bug fix**  | Grep error -> Read 2-5 files -> Edit 1-3 files -> Test -> Commit         | 1-2            |
| **Feature**  | Plan -> Models -> API -> Frontend -> Test -> Commit                      | 5-15           |
| **Refactor** | Audit -> Gap analysis -> Incremental migration -> Verify parity          | 10-30+         |
| **Upgrade**  | Research changelog -> Identify breaking changes -> Bump -> Fix consumers | Variable       |

## Error Recovery

**65% of debugging sessions resolve in 1-2 iterations.** The remaining 35% risk spiraling into 6+ iterations.

### Quick Resolution (Do This)

1. Read relevant code first (79% success correlation)
2. Form explicit hypothesis: "The issue is X because Y"
3. Make ONE targeted fix
4. Verify the fix worked

### Spiral Prevention (Avoid This)

1. **Separate error domains** — fix ALL type errors first, THEN test failures. Never interleave.
2. **3-strike rule** — after 3 failed attempts on same error: change approach entirely, or escalate.
3. **Cascade depth > 3** — pause, enumerate ALL remaining issues, fix in dependency order.
4. **Context rot** — after ~15-20 iterations, `/clear` and start fresh. A clean session with a better prompt beats accumulated corrections every time.

### The Two-Correction Rule

If you've corrected the same issue twice, `/clear` and restart. Accumulated context noise defeats accuracy.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                     | Fix                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 20+ edits without verification                   | Verify every 2-3 edits                          |
| Fix without verifying the fix (73% of fixes!)    | One fix, one verify, repeat                     |
| `fix -> fix -> fix` chains without checking      | Always verify between fixes                     |
| Editing without reading first                    | Read the file immediately before editing        |
| Writing tests from memory                        | Read actual function signatures first           |
| Changing shared types without grepping consumers | `Grep` all usages before modifying shared types |
| Mixing move and change in one commit             | Move first commit, change second commit         |
| Debugging spiral past 3 attempts                 | Change approach or escalate                     |
| Premature optimization                           | Correctness first, optimize after tests pass    |

## Cross-Model Review

For high-stakes changes, use `/hyperskills:codex-review` after implementation. A fresh model context eliminates implementation bias and catches real bugs: migration idempotency, PII in debug logging, empty array edge cases, missing batch limits.

## What This Skill is NOT

- **Not a gate.** Don't follow all five phases for a typo fix. Scale selection exists for a reason.
- **Not a replacement for reading code.** This skill tells you HOW to implement, not WHAT to implement.
- **Not a planning tool.** Use `/hyperskills:plan` for task decomposition.
- **Not an excuse to skip tests.** "Verify" means running actual checks, not eyeballing the diff.
