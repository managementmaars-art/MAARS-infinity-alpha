# Supply-Chain Protection Setup

One-time project setup to harden dependency management against supply-chain attacks.

## Idempotency

Before each step, check if the expected state already exists. If `sfw` is installed, the config already has the release-age setting, or CLAUDE.md already contains the "Dependency Supply-Chain Protection" section — skip that step and note it in the summary. This makes the skill safe to re-run without duplicating work.

## Goal

Configure the repository so all dependency operations use Socket Firewall (`sfw`) and enforce a 48-hour minimum release age policy on packages.

## Steps

### 1. Detect Package Manager

Inspect the repository for lockfiles and config, starting at the repo root and falling back to the current working directory:

| Signal | Package Manager |
|---|---|
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | pnpm |
| `yarn.lock` + `.yarnrc.yml` | Yarn Berry (2+) |
| `yarn.lock` without `.yarnrc.yml` | Yarn Classic (1.x) |
| `bun.lock` / `bun.lockb` / `bunfig.toml` | Bun |
| `package-lock.json` | npm |

If multiple signals exist, pick the one actually used in scripts / CI. For monorepos, apply config at the workspace root level. Report the decision before proceeding.

**Success criteria**: Package manager identified and stated.

### 2. Install Socket Firewall

- Run `command -v sfw` to check if `sfw` is already available.
- If missing, install globally: `npm i -g sfw`
  - If the global install fails with `EACCES`, suggest `npm i -g sfw --prefix ~/.local` or ask the user for their preferred approach.
- Verify with `sfw --version`.

**Success criteria**: `sfw` command is available and version is confirmed.

### 3. Configure 48-Hour Minimum Release Age

Apply native config for the detected package manager. Preserve existing content in all config files.

If a release-age setting already exists, keep the existing value — the user may have intentionally chosen a shorter or longer period. Only add the setting if it is missing.

**pnpm** — update `.npmrc` (pnpm reads release-age settings from `.npmrc`, not `pnpm-workspace.yaml`):
```ini
minimum-release-age=2880
```

**Yarn Berry (2+)** — update `.yarnrc.yml`:
```yaml
npmMinimalAgeGate: "2d"
```

**Yarn Classic (1.x)** — no native release-age setting exists. Skip config changes. Recommend the user migrate to pnpm or Bun for native release-age enforcement. Note this in the summary.

**Bun** — update `bunfig.toml`:
```toml
[install]
minimumReleaseAge = 172800
```

**npm** (v11.10.0+) — update `.npmrc`:
```ini
min-release-age=2
```
Note: the unit is **days** (not minutes or seconds). There is a known bug where tilde (`~`) version ranges may conflict with this setting. If npm is older than v11.10.0, skip config changes and note the limitation in the summary.

**Rules**:
- Do not invent settings the package manager does not support.
- Do not remove unrelated existing config.
- Preserve formatting when practical.

**Success criteria**: Config file updated (or skipped for npm) with the correct minimum-age setting.

### 4. Verify Setup

Run a quick smoke test to confirm the setup works end-to-end. For example:

```bash
sfw <pm> add is-odd --dry-run
```

This confirms `sfw` wraps the package manager correctly and the release-age config is picked up. If the dry-run fails, diagnose and fix before proceeding.

**Success criteria**: Dry-run install completes without errors under `sfw`.

### 5. Update CLAUDE.md

Create or update `CLAUDE.md` in the project root. If the file exists, first check whether a "Dependency Supply-Chain Protection" section already exists — if so, skip this step. Otherwise, append the section; do not overwrite existing content.

Substitute all `{{...}}` placeholders with the actual detected values before writing.

````markdown
## Dependency Supply-Chain Protection

Always prefix dependency commands with `sfw` (Socket Firewall).
Applies to install, add, update, upgrade, remove — any command that changes dependencies.

Examples: `sfw {{DETECTED_PM}} add <pkg>`, `sfw {{DETECTED_PM}} update <pkg>`.

Do not bypass `sfw` unless the human explicitly instructs it.
````

**Success criteria**: CLAUDE.md contains the supply-chain section with correct operational notes (no unsubstituted placeholders).

### 6. Summary

Output a concise summary:
- Detected package manager
- Whether `sfw` was installed or already present
- Which config file was changed (or "none" for npm)
- Whether the dry-run verification passed
- How the 48-hour rule is enforced
- Steps that were skipped (already configured)
- Any limitations

If something went wrong, note which changes were made so the user can revert via `git checkout` if needed.

**Success criteria**: User sees a clear summary of all changes.
