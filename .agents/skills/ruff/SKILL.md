# ruff — Python Linter & Formatter

ruff (v0.15.8, March 2026) is three tools in one Rust binary: linter (`ruff check`), formatter (`ruff format`), and dependency analyzer (`ruff analyze graph`). 954 rules across 57 categories. Replaces Flake8, Black, isort, pyupgrade, and dozens more.

**The built-in language server** (`ruff server`) replaces the deprecated `ruff-lsp` package (archived Dec 2025).

## Invocation

```bash
uv run ruff ...     # Project dependency (pinned version)
uvx ruff ...        # One-off (latest)
ruff ...            # Global install
```

## Rule Selection — The Critical Decision

**Default rules are minimal:** only `["E4", "E7", "E9", "F"]` — catches syntax errors and undefined names but misses most quality rules. You almost certainly need to extend this.

### select vs extend-select

| Command                    | Behavior                                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `select = ["E", "F", "B"]` | **Replaces** entire default set. Only these run.     |
| `extend-select = ["B"]`    | **Adds** to whatever `select` provides (or defaults) |

**Config inheritance trap:** When a child config specifies `select`, the parent's `ignore` list is **discarded**. This surprises people with monorepo setups.

**Specificity wins:** More specific prefixes override less specific ones. `select = ["E"]` + `ignore = ["E501"]` enables all E rules except E501.

### Recommended Selection Strategy

**New project — start broad:**

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
    "E", "W",    # pycodestyle
    "F",         # Pyflakes
    "I",         # isort
    "N",         # pep8-naming
    "UP",        # pyupgrade
    "B",         # flake8-bugbear
    "SIM",       # flake8-simplify
    "TC",        # flake8-type-checking
    "RUF",       # Ruff-specific
]
ignore = ["E501"]  # Let formatter handle line length
```

**Library / open source — maximum strictness:**

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["ALL"]
ignore = [
    # Formatter conflicts (MUST disable)
    "W191", "E111", "E114", "E117",
    "D206", "D300",
    "Q000", "Q001", "Q002", "Q003", "Q004",
    "COM812", "COM819",
    # Pydocstyle conflicts
    "D203", "D213",
    # Overly strict
    "D100", "D104",
    "ANN101", "ANN102",
    "FBT", "ERA001",
    "E501",
]

[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
"tests/**" = ["S101", "D", "ANN", "ARG"]
"scripts/**" = ["T20", "INP001"]
"**/__init__.py" = ["F401", "D104"]
```

**Legacy migration — incremental:**

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E4", "E7", "E9", "F"]
extend-select = [
    "I",      # Step 1: import sorting (safe, auto-fixable)
    "UP",     # Step 2: pyupgrade (mostly auto-fixable)
    # "B",    # Step 3: uncomment when ready
]
```

### The ALL Selector

`select = ["ALL"]` enables every stable rule. Ruff auto-disables conflicting pairs (D203/D211, D212/D213), but being explicit is better practice. Preview rules require `preview = true` and are **not** included even with ALL.

## Formatter Behavior

### Configuration

```toml
[tool.ruff.format]
quote-style = "double"           # "double" | "single" | "preserve"
indent-style = "space"           # "space" | "tab"
skip-magic-trailing-comma = false
docstring-code-format = true     # Format code in docstrings
preview = false                  # Enable 2026 style guide
```

### Rules That CONFLICT With the Formatter

When using `ruff format`, these 13 lint rules **must** be disabled:

```toml
ignore = [
    "W191", "E111", "E114", "E117",  # Indentation
    "D206", "D300",                   # Docstring formatting
    "Q000", "Q001", "Q002", "Q003", "Q004",  # Quotes
    "COM812", "COM819",               # Commas
]
```

`ISC001` only conflicts when `ISC002` is also disabled AND `allow-multiline = false`.

### Known Deviations from Black

Ruff targets >99.9% parity with Black but has 23 intentional divergences. The most impactful:

| Deviation                             | Ruff                                           | Black                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| F-string interiors                    | Formats `{expr}` contents (stable since 0.9.0) | Does not touch f-string interiors |
| Pragma comments (`# noqa`, `# type:`) | Excluded from line width                       | Counted in line width             |
| Implicit string concat                | Merges when fits on one line                   | Splits more aggressively          |
| Blank lines at block start            | Removes them                                   | Preserves them (Black 24+)        |
| Trailing comments                     | Expands statement to keep comment close        | Collapses, moves comment to end   |
| Single-element tuples                 | Always parenthesizes                           | Removes parens when safe          |

### E501 and the Formatter

The formatter makes best-effort line wrapping — it **cannot** always succeed. Comments, long strings, and URLs may exceed `line-length`. Either ignore E501 or set `lint.pycodestyle.max-line-length` higher than `line-length`.

## Fix Safety Model

```bash
ruff check --fix .                    # Safe fixes only
ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes .     # Include unsafe (review first!)
ruff check --fix --diff .             # Preview changes before applying
```

| Safety | Meaning                        | Example                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Safe   | Cannot change runtime behavior | Reordering imports                                     |
| Unsafe | May change behavior            | `list(x)[0]` -> `next(iter(x))` changes exception type |

Override per-rule:

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
extend-safe-fixes = ["RUF015"]       # Promote to safe
extend-unsafe-fixes = ["F401"]        # Demote to unsafe (require --unsafe-fixes)
```

## Suppression System

```python
# Line-level
import os  # noqa: F401

# Block-level (new in 0.15.0)
# ruff: disable[E501]
LONG_VALUE = "..."
# ruff: enable[E501]

# File-level
# ruff: noqa: F401, E501
```

```bash
ruff check --select RUF100 --fix .    # Clean up unused noqa comments
ruff check --add-noqa .               # Auto-add noqa to all violations
```

## Preview Mode

Preview is a staging area for new rules and formatter changes.

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
preview = true       # Expands defaults from 59 to 412 rules
explicit-preview-rules = true  # Require individual opt-in even with preview on
```

Preview rules are NOT activated by prefix selection or `ALL` — they require preview mode enabled. Use `explicit-preview-rules = true` to control which preview rules activate individually.

## Dependency Graph Analysis

```bash
ruff analyze graph src/                          # File dependency graph (JSON)
ruff analyze graph --direction=dependents src/   # Reverse graph
ruff analyze graph --detect-string-imports src/  # Include dynamic imports
```

Use cases: selective test running, dead code detection, circular import detection.

## Configuration

**File precedence:** `.ruff.toml` > `ruff.toml` > `pyproject.toml` (nearest wins, no merging across levels).

Falls back to `~/.config/ruff/ruff.toml` when no project config exists.

```toml
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py312"         # Inferred from requires-python if unset
line-length = 88
src = ["src", "tests"]           # First-party import classification
required-version = "==0.15.8"    # Pin version (exact match only)
extend = "../pyproject.toml"     # Inherit parent config

[tool.ruff.lint.isort]
known-first-party = ["myproject"]
combine-as-imports = true

[tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle]
convention = "google"            # "google" | "numpy" | "pep257"

[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-type-checking]
runtime-evaluated-base-classes = ["pydantic.BaseModel"]
runtime-evaluated-decorators = ["attrs.define"]
```

## Debugging

```bash
ruff check --show-settings .     # Dump resolved config
ruff check --show-files .        # List files that would be checked
ruff check --statistics .        # Count violations per rule
ruff rule E501                   # Explain a specific rule
ruff linter                      # List all available linters
```

## Non-Obvious Gotchas

| Gotcha                    | Explanation                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TCH -> TC rename          | `TCH` prefix is now legacy alias for `TC`. Use `TC` in new configs                           |
| No third-party plugins    | Ruff re-implements Flake8 plugins in Rust. Cannot install additional ones                    |
| isort differences         | Some edge cases differ from real isort (aliased imports, inline comments)                    |
| Notebooks: per-cell scope | E402 checked per-cell, not per-file. Each cell is its own module scope                       |
| `--fix` can break code    | Even "safe" fixes can break dynamic Python. Review diffs for F401, UP, B rules               |
| `ruff-lsp` is dead        | Use `ruff server` (built into binary). The separate `ruff-lsp` package was archived Dec 2025 |
| Range formatting          | `ruff format --range=10:1-20:1` formats only lines 10-20 (single file, not notebooks)        |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                       | Fix                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blanket `# noqa` on every line                     | Fix the violations or use per-file-ignores                        |
| `select = ["ALL"]` with no `ignore`                | Always pair with formatter conflict rules and overly strict rules |
| Running `ruff format` before `ruff check --fix`    | Lint fixes first (may reorder imports), then format               |
| Using `ruff-lsp`                                   | Switch to `ruff server` (built-in, maintained)                    |
| Ignoring E501 without using formatter              | Either use `ruff format` OR enforce E501, not neither             |
| `select` in child config without knowing it resets | Use `extend-select` to preserve parent's rule set                 |

## What This Skill is NOT

- Not a replacement for `ruff --help` or `ruff rule <CODE>` for specific rule docs
- Not for type checking (use ty)
- Not for package management (use uv)
- Not for third-party Flake8 plugins that ruff hasn't re-implemented
