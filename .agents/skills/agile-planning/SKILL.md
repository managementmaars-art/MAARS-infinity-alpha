# Sprint Planning

Use this skill to plan a work cycle (sprint) with clear objective, selected items, and execution order.

Initial context received via slash: $ARGUMENTS

If `$ARGUMENTS` is filled, use as reference (e.g., epic, backlog, period).
If empty, ask which backlog or initiative will be planned.

## Language

Write the artifact in the user's language. If the user communicates in Portuguese, write in Portuguese with correct grammar and accents. If in English, write in English. When in doubt, ask the user which language to use. Templates are in English — translate headers and content to match.

## Objective

- Declare the sprint objective
- Select backlog items based on value, risk, and dependency
- Record capacity and constraints
- Define execution order and highlight blockers
- Validate that each item has Definition of Ready

## Process

### 1. Declare objective

- What should the sprint deliver as an observable result?
- One phrase that guides trade-off decisions during the sprint

### 2. Review backlog

Consult:
- Epic with pending stories
- Retro with pending improvement actions
- Backlog items that have been validated via `/refinement`

### 3. Select items

For each selected item, register:
- Name and objective
- Estimated size
- Value (why now?)
- Dependencies and blockers

### 4. Validate DoR

Each item must have:
- Clear problem and objective
- Scope and out of scope recorded
- Files/areas mapped
- Verifiable acceptance criteria

If an item doesn't have DoR, it doesn't enter the sprint — needs decomposition via `/epic` or validation via `/refinement`.

### 5. Order execution

- What must be done first (unblocks the rest)?
- What can run in parallel?
- What is the critical path?

### 6. Distribute across team

When 2+ developers are available:
- Assign items to developers or tracks (e.g., Backend, Frontend)
- Identify items that can be worked on simultaneously
- Define interface contracts or mocks to avoid blocking between tracks
- Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize parallel assignments

### 7. Register commitments

- Available capacity (days, constraints, number of developers)
- Sprint commitment (selected items, assigned to whom)
- What is left out (postponed items)

## Where to save

- `planning/sprints/sprint-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Or `planning/<initiative>/sprint.md` if the sprint is dedicated to an initiative

## Chaining

- To detail the first item: suggest `/task` for the first story in the backlog
- For items that need decomposition: suggest `/epic`
- For items that need validation: suggest `/refinement`

## Reference template

Use `~/.agents/templates/planning.md` as base.

## Rules

- Don't select more items than capacity allows. Over-commitment generates frustration and inconsistency.
- Each item must have DoR. Without DoR, it doesn't enter the sprint.
- The sprint objective must be observable, not vague.
- Dependencies must be explicit — don't assume "it will fit".
- Sprint planning feeds execution. If planning doesn't generate clarity, execution will suffer.

## Relationship with the flow

```mermaid

    A["/retro"] --> B["/planning"]
    B --> C["/task"]
    C --> D[execution]
    D --> E["/status"]
    E --> F["/review"]
    F --> G["/retro"]
```

This skill starts the sprint cycle. For decomposing work, use `/epic`. For execution plans, use `/task`. For tracking during the sprint, use `/status`.
