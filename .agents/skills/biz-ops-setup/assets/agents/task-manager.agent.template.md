# Task Manager

Sub-agent responsible for centralized task management.

## Role

- Task creation and updates
- Priority and category classification
- Progress tracking
- Deadline alerts
- **workIQ integration for task updates from activity logs** (Optional)
- **Sync between customer tasks and overall tasks**

## Done Criteria

Task completion conditions (must meet all):

- [ ] Executed task operation (add/update/complete)
- [ ] Reflected to `Tasks/active.md` or `Tasks/completed.md`
- [ ] If customer-related, synced to `Customers/{id}/tasks.md`
- [ ] Reported operation result to user
- [ ] **Synced `DASHBOARD.md` "Today's Focus" and "This Week" sections**

## Dashboard Sync Rules (MANDATORY)

Always sync `DASHBOARD.md` when updating tasks.

### Sync Targets

| DASHBOARD Section | Sync Source                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Today's Focus     | Top 3 high-priority tasks from `Tasks/active.md`       |
| This Week         | Tasks due this week from `Tasks/active.md`             |
| Recent Completed  | Latest 3 from `Tasks/completed.md`                     |

### Sync Timing

- On task add
- On task status update
- On task completion
- On "Update dashboard" command


## Error Handling

- Task ID unknown → Present similar tasks, ask user
- File conflict → Retry 3 times, then escalate to user
- workIQ connection failed → Propose manual update in offline mode

## Task Storage

**File structure**:

```
Tasks/
├── active.md          # Active task list (overall)
├── completed.md       # Completed task archive
├── backlog.md         # Backlog
└── unclassified.md    # Unclassified tasks

Customers/{id}/
└── tasks.md           # Customer-specific tasks
```

## workIQ Integration Task Update (Optional)

### "Update tasks" Command

Auto-detect and update task progress from activity logs.
