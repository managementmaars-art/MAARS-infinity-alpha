# Customization Points

These files are expected to be edited immediately after workspace creation.

## Project Metadata

| File                              | Why edit it                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md`                       | Describe the book scope, workflow, and repository usage |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Define readers, goals, and project-specific constraints |

## Writing Management

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs/page-allocation.md`    | Set chapter and file-level character targets                     |
| `docs/schedule.md`           | Replace placeholder milestones and track progress                |
| `docs/naming-conventions.md` | Adjust file and image naming if the team uses a different scheme |

## Automation

| File                              | Why edit it                                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.github/agents/*.agent.md`       | Tune permissions or prompts for your team workflow       |
| `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`     | Update branch or git conventions if needed               |
| `scripts/convert_md_to_review.py` | Extend conversion rules when the manuscript format grows |

## LaTeX Style Injection Point

Build scripts that use `vvakame/review` Docker images typically copy the gem's default
`review-jsbook` files into `sty/` at the start of each build, overwriting any local edits.

### Rule

- **Never edit `sty/review-jsbook.cls` or `sty/review-base.sty` directly** — changes will be lost
- Place all LaTeX customizations in the **custom sty content** that the build script injects as `sty/review-custom.sty`
- In PowerShell build scripts, this is typically a heredoc variable (e.g. `$customStyContent`) written to a file before the Docker run
- In shell-based workflows, append to `sty/review-style.sty` **after** the gem copy step

### Why This Matters

If you add `\usepackage{xurl}` or other fixes directly to `sty/review-jsbook.cls`,
the next build silently reverts those changes. The fix appears to work in manual testing
but fails in CI or clean builds.

## Heading Rename Safety

When changing chapter titles that are also reflected in folder names, file names, or planning docs,
do not stop at the first rename.

### Recommended Rule

- Rename the manuscript heading and every synchronized path together
- Check that the old folder or file no longer exists physically
- Grep the old chapter title after the rename to catch leftovers in docs, prompts, or instructions
- Rebuild Re:VIEW/PDF output and confirm the old path is not still being converted

### Why This Matters

If the old chapter path remains on disk, build scripts may pick up both old and new files.
That can produce duplicated chapters or stale generated output that is hard to diagnose from PDF alone.

## Sync-Back from Final Manuscripts to Author Drafts

If your workflow keeps both final manuscripts and author draft folders, define a
clear sync-back rule before copying text from the final manuscript side back into
drafts.

### Recommended Rule

- Sync the prose that should stay aligned between final manuscript and draft
- Preserve draft-local relative asset paths if the draft folder uses a different image layout
- Do not blindly copy generated output back into draft folders
- Do not update unrelated sibling draft files just because they share the same author folder
- Keep keypoints, notes, and draft-only planning files as separate sources unless the task explicitly says to synchronize them
- After sync-back, verify matched manuscript pairs with `git diff --no-index`, hashes, or an equivalent exact comparison
- Treat chapter intro files such as `ch*-00_*.md` as mandatory sync-check targets because they drift easily

### Typical Example

If the final manuscript uses:

```markdown
![Azure Ops Dashboard GUI](images/image.png)
```

but the author draft keeps the image next to the draft file:

```markdown
![Azure Ops Dashboard GUI](image.png)
```

then sync the prose but preserve the draft-local image path instead of copying the final path verbatim.

### Why This Matters

Draft folders often serve as working sources for individual authors. They may have:

- different relative paths
- rough notes not intended for final manuscript
- additional sibling files such as keypoints or partial section drafts

Treat sync-back as a selective editorial sync, not as a raw mirror operation.
