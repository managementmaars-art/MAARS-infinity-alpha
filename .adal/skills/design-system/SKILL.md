description: >-
  Collaborative design system creation using Atomic Design methodology with
  a structured seven-phase process (Philosophy, Tokens, Atoms, Molecules,
  Organisms, Templates, Assembly). Produces a specification artifact with
  philosophy traceability, named design tokens, and full component hierarchy.
  Use when creating a design system, defining a visual language, specifying
  UI tokens (colors, typography, spacing), building a component catalog, or
  planning component architecture before implementation. Triggers on: "create
  a design system", "define design tokens", "component library spec", "visual
  language", "atoms and molecules", "style guide", "UI philosophy", "component
  hierarchy". NOT for: implementing components in code (use atomic-design),
  choosing frameworks (use architecture-decisions).

# Design System

**Value:** Communication -- a documented design system creates shared
vocabulary for every visual decision. When philosophy is explicit and
tokens are named, contributors extend the system consistently without
guessing at intent.

## Purpose

Facilitates collaborative creation of a design system specification.
Produces an artifact at `docs/design-system.pen` (if Pencil MCP is
available) or `docs/design-system.html` (single-file fallback) that
documents philosophy, tokens, and the full component hierarchy from
atoms through templates.

## Practices

### Detect Artifact Format

Check whether the `mcp__pencil__get_editor_state` tool is available.

- **Present:** Use `.pen` format. Follow `references/pencil-workflow.md`.
- **Absent:** Use HTML format. Follow `references/html-artifact.md`.

Decide the format before starting any design work. Do not switch formats
mid-process.

### Follow the Seven-Phase Collaborative Process

You MUST follow `references/design-phases.md` for the full methodology.
Each phase completes before the next begins.

**Phases at a glance:**

1. **Philosophy & Constraints** -- Brand, principles, accessibility,
   responsive strategy, constraints. Every subsequent decision traces here.
2. **Design Tokens** -- Color, typography, spacing, radii, elevation,
   motion, breakpoints, opacity. Each token cites a philosophy principle.
3. **Atoms** -- Indivisible elements (buttons, inputs, labels, icons).
   Each documents states and references only tokens.
4. **Molecules** -- Functional units composed of atoms (form fields,
   search bars). Documents composition and interaction.
5. **Organisms** -- Distinct UI sections composed of molecules and atoms
   (headers, forms, data tables). Documents layout behavior.
6. **Templates** -- Page layouts arranging organisms. Defines structure,
   content slots, and breakpoint behavior.
7. **Artifact Assembly** -- Compile into the chosen format with
   philosophy as the first section.

### Facilitate, Do Not Assume

You are a facilitator, not a stenographer. Ask probing questions at each
phase. Challenge choices that conflict with stated philosophy. Use
`references/facilitation-questions.md` for question banks.

1. Do not assume visual preferences -- ask
2. Do not skip ahead when the user gives a partial answer -- probe deeper
3. If event model wireframes exist in `docs/event_model/`, use them to
   identify required components, but still confirm with the user
4. Present token proposals informed by the philosophy and ask for
   adjustments

### Enforce Philosophy Traceability

Every design decision traces back to the philosophy.

- Tokens cite which philosophy principle they serve (e.g., `P1`)
- Atoms reference which tokens they use
- Molecules document which atoms they compose
- Organisms document which molecules and atoms they compose
- Templates document which organisms they arrange

If a token cannot cite a principle, either the token is unnecessary or
the philosophy is incomplete. Resolve before proceeding.

**Do:**
- Define philosophy before any visual decisions
- Use only token references in components -- never raw values
- Complete each phase before starting the next
- Verify traceability at every level
- Refer to `references/token-categories.md` for comprehensive token guidance

**Do not:**
- Make technology decisions (CSS framework, component library) -- those
  belong in architecture-decisions
- Skip the philosophy phase or treat it as optional
- Use raw color codes, pixel values, or font names in components
- Design multiple phases simultaneously
- Proceed with gaps -- if something is undefined, ask

## Enforcement Note

Advisory in all modes. Phase gates are self-enforced: the agent must
complete each phase's outputs and get user confirmation before proceeding.
Token traceability is self-enforced: the agent must verify every component
references tokens, not raw values.

**Hard constraints:**
- Phase ordering (complete each phase before starting the next): `[RP]`

## Constraints

- **"No raw values in components"**: This means no literal color codes, pixel
  values, font sizes, or spacing values anywhere in component definitions.
  "I defined a token for it" is not sufficient if the component file contains
  the raw value instead of the token reference. Defining many single-use
  tokens to technically satisfy this rule while defeating reusability is also
  a violation.
- **Philosophy phase**: Philosophy means named principles with enough
  specificity to guide decisions. "Modern and clean" is not a philosophy --
  it constrains nothing. Each principle should be testable: given a design
  decision, the principle should help you choose between options. If it
  doesn't eliminate any option, it's not specific enough.

## Verification

After completing work guided by this skill, verify:

- [ ] Philosophy documented with named principles before any components
- [ ] Tokens defined for all visual categories (color, typography,
      spacing, radii, elevation, motion, breakpoints, opacity)
- [ ] Every token cites a philosophy principle
- [ ] Atoms reference only tokens (no raw values)
- [ ] Molecules compose only atoms from the catalog
- [ ] Organisms compose only molecules and atoms from the catalog
- [ ] Templates arrange only organisms from the catalog
- [ ] All component states documented (default, hover, focus, disabled,
      error as applicable)
- [ ] Wireframe fields mapped to components if event model exists
- [ ] Artifact exists at `docs/design-system.pen` or
      `docs/design-system.html`
- [ ] Philosophy is the first section in the artifact

If any criterion is not met, revisit the relevant phase before proceeding.

## Dependencies

This skill works standalone. For enhanced workflows, it integrates with:

- **event-modeling:** Wireframes from event modeling sessions identify
  which components the design system must include. Run event-modeling
  first for best results.
- **architecture-decisions:** The design system specification informs
  technology decisions for UI implementation (CSS framework, component
  library, build tooling). Run design-system before architecture-decisions.
- **atomic-design:** The design system specification provides the token
  definitions, component catalog, and hierarchy that atomic-design
  implements in code.
- **tdd:** Token values and component specifications become testable
  contracts -- visual regression tests verify token compliance.
