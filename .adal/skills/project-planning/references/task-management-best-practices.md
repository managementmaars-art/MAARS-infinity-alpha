# Task Management Best Practices

## Task Organization

**Task Attributes:**

```markdown
Task: Implement User Login API

ID: TASK-142
Type: Development
Status: In Progress
Priority: High
Assignee: Developer 1
Story: User Login (STORY-28)
Sprint: Sprint 15

Estimated: 4 hours
Actual: 3 hours
Remaining: 1 hour

Tags: backend, authentication, api
Blocked: No
Dependencies: TASK-141 (Database schema)

Description:
Implement POST /api/auth/login endpoint with email/password validation,
JWT token generation, and error handling.

Acceptance:
- [ ] Validates email format
- [ ] Checks password against hash
- [ ] Returns JWT token on success
- [ ] Returns appropriate errors
- [ ] Includes refresh token
- [ ] Unit tests written
```

### Dependency Management

**Dependency Types:**

1. **Finish-to-Start (FS)**: Task B can't start until Task A finishes
2. **Start-to-Start (SS)**: Task B can't start until Task A starts
3. **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**: Task B can't finish until Task A finishes
4. **Start-to-Finish (SF)**: Task B can't finish until Task A starts (rare)

**Critical Path Identification:**

```
Authentication Flow:
[DB Schema] → [API Endpoint] → [Frontend Form] → [Integration Test]
   2h            4h               4h                2h
Critical Path: 12 hours (blocks other work)

Profile Management:
[UI Mockup] → [Frontend] → [API] → [Test]
   4h          6h          3h       2h
Non-critical: Can proceed in parallel with auth
```

### Communication and Documentation

**Status Updates:**

```markdown
Weekly Status Report - Week of Jan 15

Completed This Week:
- ✅ User registration API and UI (STORY-27)
- ✅ Email verification service (STORY-29)
- ✅ Database migration for user tables

In Progress:
- ⏳ User login implementation (STORY-28) - 80% complete
- ⏳ Password reset flow (STORY-30) - Design review pending

Blocked:
- 🚫 OAuth integration (STORY-31) - Waiting for API keys from Google

Risks/Issues:
- Email service rate limits causing delays in testing
- One developer out sick, may impact sprint velocity

Next Week Plan:
- Complete login and password reset
- Begin profile management features
- Address technical debt in authentication module
```

**Decision Log:**

```markdown
Decision: Use JWT for Authentication

Date: Jan 10, 2026
Status: Approved
Participants: Tech Lead, Backend Team, Security Consultant

Context:
Need to choose authentication mechanism for API

Options Considered:
1. Session-based authentication
2. JWT tokens
3. OAuth only

Decision: JWT with refresh tokens

Reasoning:
- Stateless, scalable for microservices
- Works well for mobile and SPA
- Industry standard with good library support
- Refresh tokens mitigate security concerns

Consequences:
- Must implement token refresh logic
- Need secure storage on client side
- Will require careful key management
```
