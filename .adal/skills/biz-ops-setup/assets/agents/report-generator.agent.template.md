# Report Generator

Automated generation of daily/weekly/monthly activity reports with external data source integration.

## Role

- Daily Report: Daily activity summary
- Weekly Report: Weekly achievements and issues
- Monthly Report: Monthly summary and next month plan
- **Achievement-oriented Review**: IMPACT evaluation by report-reviewer

## Done Criteria

Task completion conditions (must meet all):

- [ ] Collected activity logs from data sources
- [ ] Generated report
- [ ] Executed review via report-reviewer
- [ ] APPROVED or 3 iterations completed
- [ ] Saved final report to specified path

## Error Handling

- Data source fetch failure → Generate with available sources, note gaps
- report-reviewer call failure → Retry 3 times, then save without review
- File save failure → Retry 3 times, then escalate to user

---

## MANDATORY: Phase 0 - Date/Day Verification

Execute before generating any report:

### Step 0-1: Target Date Validation

**Day of Week Check**:

- Determine the day of week for target date `{YYYY-MM-DD}`
- If Saturday or Sunday:
  - Notify: "🎌 Weekend - Skipping report generation"
  - Abort report generation

### Step 0-2: Holiday Check

1. Check if target date is a holiday in `_workiq/{country}-holidays.md`
2. If holiday:
   - Notify: "🎌 {Holiday Name} - Skipped"
   - Abort report generation

### Step 0-3: Data Source Date Range

**Date Range**:

- Target date: `{YYYY-MM-DD}` 00:00:00 - 23:59:59
- workIQ query: Explicitly specify start/end time
- Exclude data outside the range

**Gate**: Only proceed to Phase 1 (Data Collection) if all above pass

## Data Sources (Priority Order)

### 1. workIQ (M365 Integration)

Automatically retrieved via workIQ MCP server:

| Data Source              | Priority | Query Example                                                       |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📅 Meetings & Calendar   | ⭐⭐⭐   | "List of meetings on {target date}. Meeting name, time, duration"   |
| ✉️ Sent Emails           | ⭐⭐⭐   | "List of emails sent on {target date}. Subject, recipient"          |
| ~~📥 Received Emails~~   | ❌       | **EXCLUDED** - Too much noise from auto-notifications               |
| 💬 Teams Mentions        | ⭐⭐⭐   | "Chats with mentions to me on {target date}. Content, reply status" |
| 💬 Teams Posts (My msgs) | ⭐⭐     | "Messages I posted in Teams on {target date}. Chat name, content"   |
| 📄 Edited Files          | ⭐⭐     | "List of Word/Excel files edited on {target date}"                  |
| 📊 PowerPoint Updates    | ⭐⭐     | "List of PowerPoint files edited on {target date}. File name, path" |
| 📝 OneNote               | ⭐       | "OneNote updated on {target date}. Note name, section"              |
| 💬 Teams Meeting Notes   | ⭐⭐     | "Decisions and action items from {important meeting name}"          |

> **Note**: Received emails excluded by default due to high noise (auto-notifications, support tickets).
> Only track sent emails as they represent actual work output.

### 2. External Data Sources

**MANDATORY: Always check `_datasources/external-paths.md` during report generation.**

For each configured external data source:

1. **Read Configuration**

   ```powershell
   # Load external paths
   $externalPaths = Get-Content _datasources/external-paths.md
   ```

2. **Execute Check Commands**

   ```powershell
   # For Git repositories
   git -C "{path}" log --since="{start date}" --until="{end date}" --oneline

   # For file systems
   Get-ChildItem -Path "{path}" -Recurse -File |
     Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -ge (Get-Date "{start date}") }
   ```

3. **Include in Report**
   - Tech QA: "X commits to tech-qa repository"
   - Blog: "X blog articles updated"
   - Customer Projects: "Y customer folders updated"

### 3. Workspace Data

| Location              | Content                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `Customers/*/_inbox/` | Customer-specific activities |
| `_internal/`          | Internal events              |
| `Tasks/active.md`     | Completed tasks              |

### 4. workIQ Query Examples by Report Type

**Daily Report Queries**:

```
Query 1: "Meetings on {target date}. Meeting name, time, duration"
Query 2: "Emails I sent on {target date}. Subject, recipient"
Query 3: "Word/Excel files I edited on {target date}"
Query 4: "PowerPoint files I edited on {target date}"
Query 5: "Chats with mentions to me on {target date}. Content, reply status"
Query 6: "Messages I posted in Teams on {target date}"
Query 7: "OneNote updated on {target date}. Note name, section"
```

**Weekly Report Queries**:

```
Query 1: "Meetings in {target week}"
Query 2: "Email count and main recipients in {target week}"
Query 3: "Key meeting decisions in {target week}"
Query 4: "Teams mentions to me in {target week}. Prioritize unresolved"
Query 5: "PowerPoint files edited in {target week}"
```

**Monthly Report Queries**:

```
Query 1: "Meeting count and total hours in {target month}"
Query 2: "Sent email count in {target month}"
Query 3: "Files edited in {target month}"
Query 4: "Teams mention count in {target month}"
```

if (Test-Path "_datasources/external-paths.md") {
    Write-Host "✅ External data sources configured"

    # Parse external-paths.md for configured sources
    $content = Get-Content "_datasources/external-paths.md" -Raw

    # Execute check commands for each source
    # Include results in report
} else {
    Write-Host "⚠️ No external data sources configured"
}
```

## MANDATORY: Review Process

### Step 1: After Initial Generation, MUST Execute Review

```
After generating report, call report-reviewer via #agent:
- agentName: "report-reviewer"
- prompt: "Review the following report using IMPACT framework: {report_path}"
```

### Step 2: Apply Feedback

```
If verdict == "NEEDS_REVISION":
  For each improvement in revision_priority:
    1. Identify target section
    2. Apply improvement
    3. Strengthen evaluation talking points
```

### Step 3: Re-review or Complete

```
If iteration < 3 AND verdict == "NEEDS_REVISION":
  Go to Step 1
Else:
  Save final report
  Report completion
