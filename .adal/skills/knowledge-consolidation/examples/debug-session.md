# Image Cache Memory Leak Fix

> **Type:** debug
> **Date:** 2026-02-23
> **Context:** Investigating app memory growth during image browsing

## Summary

Identified retain cycle in ImageCacheManager caused by strong self reference
in async completion handler. Fixed by using [weak self] capture list.

## Background

App memory continuously grew when users scrolled through image gallery.
Memory profiler showed ImageCacheManager instances never deallocated.

## Details

Root cause: Strong reference cycle in completion handler

```swift
// Before (retain cycle)
imageLoader.load(url: url) { result in
    self.cache[url] = result  // strong self capture
}

// After (fixed)
imageLoader.load(url: url) { [weak self] result in
    self?.cache[url] = result
}
```
````

## Key Takeaways

- Always use [weak self] in async closures stored by the object
- Use Instruments Leaks template to detect retain cycles
- Check completion handlers when investigating memory growth
