## 1. What is an Asset Pipeline?

The Rails Asset Pipeline is a library designed for organizing, caching, and
serving static assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and image files. It streamlines
and optimizes the management of these assets to enhance the performance and
maintainability of the application.

The Rails Asset Pipeline is managed by
Propshaft. Propshaft is built for an
era where transpilation, bundling and compression are less critical for basic
applications, thanks to better browser support, faster networks and HTTP/2
capabilities.

Propshaft focuses on essential asset management tasks and leaves more complex
tasks, such as JavaScript and CSS bundling and minification, to specialized
tools like jsbundling-rails and
cssbundling-rails, which can be
added separately to your application. Propshaft focuses on
fingerprinting and
emphasizes generating digest-based URLs for assets, allowing browsers to cache
them, thus minimizing the need for intricate compilation and bundling.

The Propshaft gem is enabled by default in
new applications. If, for some reason, you want to disable it during setup, you
can use the --skip-asset-pipeline option:

```bash
rails new app_name --skip-asset-pipeline
```

Before Rails 8, the asset pipeline was powered by
Sprockets. You can read about the
Sprockets Asset
Pipeline in previous
versions of the Rails Guides. You can also explore the evolution of asset
management techniques to see how the
Rails Asset Pipeline has evolved over time.

## 2. Propshaft Features

Propshaft expects that your assets are already in a browser-ready format—like
plain CSS, JavaScript, or preprocessed images (like JPEGs or PNGs). Its job is
to organize, version, and serve those assets efficiently. In this section, we’ll
cover the main features of Propshaft and how they work.

### 2.1. Asset Load Order

With Propshaft, you can control the loading order of dependent files by
specifying each file explicitly and organizing them manually or ensuring they
are included in the correct sequence within your HTML or layout files. This
ensures that dependencies are managed and loaded without relying on automated
dependency management tools. Below are some strategies for managing
dependencies:

- Manually include assets in the correct order:In your HTML layout (usually application.html.erb for Rails apps) you can
specify the exact order for loading CSS and JavaScript files by including
each file individually in a specific order. For example:
<!-- application.html.erb -->
<head>
 <%= stylesheet_link_tag "reset" %>
 <%= stylesheet_link_tag "base" %>
 <%= stylesheet_link_tag "main" %>
</head>
<body>
 <%= javascript_include_tag "utilities" %>
 <%= javascript_include_tag "main" %>
</body>

This is important if, for instance, main.js relies on utilities.js to be
loaded first.

- Use Modules in JavaScript (ES6)If you have dependencies within JavaScript files, ES6 modules can help. By
using import statements, you can explicitly control dependencies within
JavaScript code. Just make sure your JavaScript files are set up as modules
using <script type="module"> in your HTML:
// main.js
import { initUtilities } from "./utilities.js";
import { setupFeature } from "./feature.js";

initUtilities();
setupFeature();

Then in your layout:
<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>

This way, you can manage dependencies within JavaScript files without
relying on Propshaft to understand them. By importing modules, you can
control the order in which files are loaded and ensure dependencies are met.

- Combine Files when necessaryIf you have several JavaScript or CSS files that must always load together,
you can combine them into a single file. For example, you could create a
combined.js file that imports or copies code from other scripts. Then,
just include combined.js in your layout to avoid dealing with individual
file ordering. This can be useful for files that always load together, like
a set of utility functions or a group of styles for a specific component.
While this approach can work for small projects or simple use cases, it can
become tedious and error-prone for larger applications.

- Bundle your JavaScript or CSS using a bundlerIf your project requires features like dependency chaining or CSS
pre-processing, you may want to consider advanced asset
management alongside Propshaft.Tools like jsbundling-rails
integrates Bun, esbuild,
rollup.js, or Webpack
into your Rails application, while
cssbundling-rails can be
used to process stylesheets that use Tailwind
CSS, Bootstrap,
Bulma, PostCSS, or Dart
Sass.These tools complement Propshaft by handling the complex processing, while
Propshaft efficiently organizes and serves the final assets.

Manually include assets in the correct order:

In your HTML layout (usually application.html.erb for Rails apps) you can
specify the exact order for loading CSS and JavaScript files by including
each file individually in a specific order. For example:

```ruby
<!-- application.html.erb -->
<head>
 <%= stylesheet_link_tag "reset" %>
 <%= stylesheet_link_tag "base" %>
 <%= stylesheet_link_tag "main" %>
</head>
<body>
 <%= javascript_include_tag "utilities" %>
 <%= javascript_include_tag "main" %>
</body>
```

This is important if, for instance, main.js relies on utilities.js to be
loaded first.

Use Modules in JavaScript (ES6)

If you have dependencies within JavaScript files, ES6 modules can help. By
using import statements, you can explicitly control dependencies within
JavaScript code. Just make sure your JavaScript files are set up as modules
using <script type="module"> in your HTML:

```
// main.js
import { initUtilities } from "./utilities.js";
import { setupFeature } from "./feature.js";

initUtilities();
setupFeature();
```

Then in your layout:

```
<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
```

This way, you can manage dependencies within JavaScript files without
relying on Propshaft to understand them. By importing modules, you can
control the order in which files are loaded and ensure dependencies are met.

Combine Files when necessary

If you have several JavaScript or CSS files that must always load together,
you can combine them into a single file. For example, you could create a
combined.js file that imports or copies code from other scripts. Then,
just include combined.js in your layout to avoid dealing with individual
file ordering. This can be useful for files that always load together, like
a set of utility functions or a group of styles for a specific component.
While this approach can work for small projects or simple use cases, it can
become tedious and error-prone for larger applications.

Bundle your JavaScript or CSS using a bundler

If your project requires features like dependency chaining or CSS
pre-processing, you may want to consider advanced asset
management alongside Propshaft.

Tools like jsbundling-rails
integrates Bun, esbuild,
rollup.js, or Webpack
into your Rails application, while
cssbundling-rails can be
used to process stylesheets that use Tailwind
CSS, Bootstrap,
Bulma, PostCSS, or Dart
Sass.

These tools complement Propshaft by handling the complex processing, while
Propshaft efficiently organizes and serves the final assets.

### 2.2. Asset Organization

Propshaft organizes assets within the app/assets directory, which includes
subdirectories like images, javascripts, and stylesheets. You can place
your JavaScript, CSS, image files, and other assets into these directories, and
Propshaft will manage them during the precompilation process.

You can also specify additional asset paths for Propshaft to search by modifying
config.assets.paths in your config/initializers/assets.rb file. For example:

```ruby
# Add additional assets to the asset load path.
Rails.application.config.assets.paths << Emoji.images_path
```

Propshaft will make all assets from the configured paths available for serving.
During the precompilation process, Propshaft copies these assets into the
public/assets directory, ensuring they are ready for production use.

Assets can be referenced through their logical
paths using helpers like asset_path, image_tag,
javascript_include_tag, and other asset helper tags. After running
assets:precompile in production, these logical references are
automatically converted into their fingerprinted paths using the
.manifest.json file.

It is possible to exclude certain directories from this process, you can read more
about it in the Fingerprinting
section.

### 2.3. Fingerprinting: Versioning with digest-based URLs

In Rails, asset versioning uses fingerprinting to add unique identifiers to
asset filenames.

Fingerprinting is a technique that makes the name of a file dependent on its
content. A digest of the file's content is generated and appended to the
filename. This ensures that when the file content changes, its digest—and
consequently its filename—also changes. This mechanism is crucial for caching
assets effectively, as the browser will always load the updated version of an
asset when its content changes, thereby improving performance. For static or
infrequently changed content, this provides an easy way to tell whether two
versions of a file are identical, even across different servers or deployment
dates.

#### 2.3.1. Asset Digesting

As mentioned in the Asset Organization section, in
Propshaft, all assets from the paths configured in config.assets.paths are
available for serving and will be copied into the public/assets directory.

When fingerprinted, an asset filename  like styles.css is renamed to
styles-a1b2c3d4e5f6.css. This ensures that if styles.css is updated, the
filename changes as well, compelling the browser to download the latest version
instead of using a potentially outdated cached copy.

#### 2.3.2. Manifest Files

In Propshaft, the .manifest.json file is automatically generated during the
asset precompilation process. This file maps original asset filenames to their
fingerprinted versions, ensuring proper cache invalidation and efficient asset
management. Located in the public/assets directory, the .manifest.json file
helps Rails resolve asset paths at runtime, allowing it to reference the correct
fingerprinted files.

The .manifest.json includes entries for main assets like application.js and
application.css as well as other files, such as images. Here's an example of
what the JSON might look like:

```
{
  "application.css": "application-6d58c9e6e3b5d4a7c9a8e3.css",
  "application.js": "application-2d4b9f6c5a7c8e2b8d9e6.js",
  "logo.png": "logo-f3e8c9b2a6e5d4c8.png",
  "favicon.ico": "favicon-d6c8e5a9f3b2c7.ico"
}
```

When a filename is unique and based on its content, HTTP headers can be set to
encourage caches everywhere (whether at CDNs, at ISPs, in networking equipment,
or in web browsers) to keep their own copy of the content. When the content is
updated, the fingerprint will change. This will cause the remote clients to
request a new copy of the content. This is generally known as cache busting.

#### 2.3.3. Digested Assets in Views

You can reference digested assets in your views using standard Rails asset
helpers like asset_path, image_tag, javascript_include_tag,
stylesheet_link_tag and others.

For example, in your layout file, you can include a stylesheet like this:

```ruby
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all" %>
```

If you're using the turbo-rails gem
(which is included by default in Rails), you can include the data-turbo-track
option. This causes Turbo to check if an asset has been updated and, if so,
reload it into the page:

```ruby
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>
```

You can access images in the app/assets/images directory like this:

```ruby
<%= image_tag "rails.png" %>
```

When the asset pipeline is enabled, Propshaft will serve this file. If a file
exists at public/assets/rails.png, it will be served by the web server.

Alternatively, if you are using fingerprinted assets (e.g.,
rails-f90d8a84c707a8dc923fca1ca1895ae8ed0a09237f6992015fef1e11be77c023.png),
Propshaft will also serve these correctly. The fingerprint is automatically
applied during the precompilation process.

Images can be organized into subdirectories, and you can reference them by
specifying the directory in the tag:

```ruby
<%= image_tag "icons/rails.png" %>
```

Finally, you can reference an image in your CSS like:

```
background: url("/bg/pattern.svg");
```

Propshaft will automatically convert this to:

```
background: url("/assets/bg/pattern-2169cbef.svg");
```

If you're precompiling your assets (see the Production
section), linking to an asset that doesn't exist will raise an
exception in the calling page. This includes linking to a blank string. Be
careful when using image_tag and other helpers with user-supplied data. This
ensures that the browser always fetches the correct version of the asset.

#### 2.3.4. Digested Assets in JavaScript

In JavaScript, you need to manually trigger the asset transformation using the
RAILS_ASSET_URL macro. Here’s an example:

```
export default class extends Controller {
  init() {
    this.img = RAILS_ASSET_URL("/icons/trash.svg");
  }
}
```

This will transform into:

```
export default class extends Controller {
  init() {
    this.img = "/assets/icons/trash-54g9cbef.svg";
  }
}
```

This ensures that the correct, digested file is used in your JavaScript code.

If you’re using bundlers like Webpack or
esbuild, you should let the bundlers handle the
digesting process. If Propshaft detects that a file already has a digest in the
filename (e.g., script-2169cbef.js), it will skip digesting the file again to
avoid unnecessary reprocessing.

For managing assets with Import Maps, Propshaft ensures that
assets referenced in the import map are appropriately handled and mapped to
their digested paths during the precompilation process.

#### 2.3.5. Bypassing the Digest Step

If you need to reference files that refer to each other—like a JavaScript file
and its source map—and want to avoid the digesting process, you can pre-digest
these files manually. Propshaft recognizes files with the pattern
-[digest].digested.js as files that have already been digested and will
preserve their stable file names.

#### 2.3.6. Excluding Directories from Digestion

You can exclude certain directories from the precompilation and digestion
process by adding them to config.assets.excluded_paths. This is useful if, for
example, you’re using app/assets/stylesheets as input to a compiler like Dart
Sass, and you don’t want these files to be part of the
asset load path.

```ruby
config.assets.excluded_paths = [Rails.root.join("app/assets/stylesheets")]
```

This will prevent the specified directories from being processed by Propshaft
while still allowing them to be part of the precompilation process.

## 3. Working with Propshaft

From Rails 8 onwards, Propshaft is included by default. To use Propshaft, you
need to configure it properly and organize your assets in a way that Rails can
serve them efficiently.

### 3.1. Setup

Follow these steps for setting up Propshaft in your Rails application:

- Create a new Rails application:
$ rails new app_name

- Organize your assets:Propshaft expects your assets to be in the app/assets directory. You can
organize your assets into subdirectories like app/assets/javascripts for
JavaScript files, app/assets/stylesheets for CSS files, and
app/assets/images for images.For example, you can create a new JavaScript file in
app/assets/javascripts:
// app/assets/javascripts/main.js
console.log("Hello, world!");

and a new CSS file in app/assets/stylesheets:
/*app/assets/stylesheets/main.css*/
body {
  background-color: red;
}

- Link assets in your application layoutIn your application layout file (usually
app/views/layouts/application.html.erb), you can include your assets using
the stylesheet_link_tag and javascript_include_tag helpers:
<!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>MyApp</title>
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "main" %>
  </head>
  <body>
    <%= yield %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag "main" %>
  </body>
</html>

This layout includes the main.css stylesheet and main.js JavaScript file
in your application.

- Start the Rails server:
$ bin/rails server

- Preview your application:Open your web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000>. You should
see your Rails application with the included assets.

Create a new Rails application:

```bash
rails new app_name
```

Organize your assets:

Propshaft expects your assets to be in the app/assets directory. You can
organize your assets into subdirectories like app/assets/javascripts for
JavaScript files, app/assets/stylesheets for CSS files, and
app/assets/images for images.

For example, you can create a new JavaScript file in
app/assets/javascripts:

```
// app/assets/javascripts/main.js
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

and a new CSS file in app/assets/stylesheets:

```
/* app/assets/stylesheets/main.css */
body {
  background-color: red;
}
```

Link assets in your application layout

In your application layout file (usually
app/views/layouts/application.html.erb), you can include your assets using
the stylesheet_link_tag and javascript_include_tag helpers:

```ruby
<!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>MyApp</title>
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "main" %>
  </head>
  <body>
    <%= yield %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag "main" %>
  </body>
</html>
```

This layout includes the main.css stylesheet and main.js JavaScript file
in your application.

Start the Rails server:

```bash
bin/rails server
```

Preview your application:

Open your web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000>. You should
see your Rails application with the included assets.

### 3.2. Development

Rails and Propshaft are configured differently in development than in
production, to allow rapid iteration without manual intervention.

#### 3.2.1. No Caching

In development, Rails is configured to bypass asset caching. This means that
when you modify assets (e.g., CSS, JavaScript), Rails will serve the most
up-to-date version directly from the file system. There's no need to worry about
versioning or file renaming because caching is skipped entirely. Browsers will
automatically pull in the latest version each time you reload the page.

#### 3.2.2. Automatic Reloading of Assets

When using Propshaft on its own, it automatically checks for updates to assets
like JavaScript, CSS, or images with every request. This means you can edit
these files, reload the browser, and instantly see the changes without needing
to restart the Rails server.

When using JavaScript bundlers such as esbuild or
Webpack alongside Propshaft, the workflow combines
both tools effectively:

- The bundler watches for changes in your JavaScript and CSS files, compiles
them into the appropriate build directory, and keeps the files up to date.

- Propshaft ensures that the latest compiled assets are served to the browser
whenever a request is made.

For these setups, running ./bin/dev starts both the Rails server and the asset
bundler's development server.

In either case, Propshaft ensures that changes to your assets are reflected as
soon as the browser page is reloaded, without requiring a server restart.

#### 3.2.3. Improving Performance with File Watchers

In development, Propshaft checks if any assets have been updated before each
request, using the application's file watcher (by default,
ActiveSupport::FileUpdateChecker). If you have a large number of assets, you
can improve performance by using the listen gem and configuring the following
setting in config/environments/development.rb:

```ruby
config.file_watcher = ActiveSupport::EventedFileUpdateChecker
```

This will reduce the overhead of checking for file updates and improve
performance during development.

### 3.3. Production

In production, Rails serves assets with caching enabled to optimize performance,
ensuring that your application can handle high traffic efficiently.

#### 3.3.1. Asset Caching and Versioning in Production

As mentioned in the Fingerprinting
section when the file
content changes, its digest also changes, thus the browser uses the updated
version of the file. Whereas, if the content remains the same, the browser will
use the cached version.

#### 3.3.2. Precompiling Assets

In production, precompilation is typically run during deployment to ensure that
the latest versions of the assets are served. Propshaft was explicitly not
designed to provide full transpiler capabilities. However, it does offer an
input -> output compiler setup that by default is used to translate url(asset)
function calls in CSS to url(digested-asset) instead and source mapping
comments likewise.

To manually run precompilation you can use the following command:

```bash
RAILS_ENV=production rails assets:precompile
```

After doing this, all assets in the load path will be copied (or compiled when
using advanced asset management) in the
precompilation step and stamped with a digest hash.

Additionally, you can set ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE_DUMMY"] to trigger the use of a
randomly generated secret_key_base that’s stored in a temporary file. This is
useful when precompiling assets for production as part of a build step that
otherwise does not need access to the production secrets.

```bash
RAILS_ENV=production SECRET_KEY_BASE_DUMMY=1 rails assets:precompile
```

By default, assets are served from the /assets directory.

Running the precompile command in development generates a marker file
named .manifest.json, which tells the application that it can serve the
compiled assets. As a result, any changes you make to your source assets won't
be reflected in the browser until the precompiled assets are updated. If your
assets stop updating in development mode, the solution is to remove the
.manifest.json file located in public/assets/.  You can use the rails
assets:clobber command to delete all your precompiled assets and the
.manifest.json file. This will force Rails to recompile the assets on the fly,
reflecting the latest changes.

Always ensure that the expected compiled filenames end with .js or
.css.

Precompiled assets exist on the file system and are served directly by your web
server. They do not have far-future headers by default, so to get the benefit of
fingerprinting you'll have to update your server configuration to add those
headers.

For Apache:

```
# The Expires* directives require the Apache module
# `mod_expires` to be enabled.
<Location /assets/>
  # Use of ETag is discouraged when Last-Modified is present
  Header unset ETag
  FileETag None
  # RFC says only cache for 1 year
  ExpiresActive On
  ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"
</Location>
```

For NGINX:

```
location ~ ^/assets/ {
  expires 1y;
  add_header Cache-Control public;

  add_header ETag "";
}
```

#### 3.3.3. CDNs

CDN stands for Content Delivery
Network, they are
primarily designed to cache assets all over the world so that when a browser
requests the asset, a cached copy will be geographically close to that browser.
If you are serving assets directly from your Rails server in production, the
best practice is to use a CDN in front of your application.

A common pattern for using a CDN is to set your production application as the
"origin" server. This means when a browser requests an asset from the CDN and
there is a cache miss, it will instead source the file from your server and then
cache it. For example if you are running a Rails application on example.com
and have a CDN configured at mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com, then when a
request is made to mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com/assets/smile.png, the CDN
will query your server once at example.com/assets/smile.png and cache the
request. The next request to the CDN that comes in to the same URL will hit the
cached copy. When the CDN can serve an asset directly the request never touches
your Rails server. Since the assets from a CDN are geographically closer to the
browser, the request is faster, and since your server doesn't need to spend time
serving assets, it can focus on serving application code.

To set up CDN, your application needs to be running in production on the
internet at a publicly available URL, for example example.com. Next you'll
need to sign up for a CDN service from a cloud hosting provider. When you do
this you need to configure the "origin" of the CDN to point back at your website
example.com. Check your provider for documentation on configuring the origin
server.

The CDN you provisioned should give you a custom subdomain for your application
such as mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com (note fictional-cdn.com is not a
valid CDN provider at the time of this writing). Now that you have configured
your CDN server, you need to tell browsers to use your CDN to grab assets
instead of your Rails server directly. You can do this by configuring Rails to
set your CDN as the asset host instead of using a relative path. To set your
asset host in Rails, you need to set config.asset_host in
config/environments/production.rb:

```ruby
config.asset_host = "mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com"
```

You only need to provide the "host", this is the subdomain and root
domain, you do not need to specify a protocol or "scheme" such as http:// or
https://. When a web page is requested, the protocol in the link to your asset
that is generated will match how the webpage is accessed by default.

You can also set this value through an environment
variable to make running a
staging copy of your site easier:

```ruby
config.asset_host = ENV["CDN_HOST"]
```

You would need to set CDN_HOST on your server to mycdnsubdomain
.fictional-cdn.com for this to work.

Once you have configured your server and your CDN, asset paths from helpers such
as:

```ruby
<%= asset_path('smile.png') %>
```

Will be rendered as full CDN URLs like
<http://mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com/assets/smile.png> (digest omitted for
readability).

If the CDN has a copy of smile.png, it will serve it to the browser,  and the
origin server won't even know it was requested. If the CDN does not have a copy,
it will try to find it at the "origin" example.com/assets/smile.png, and then
store it for future use.

If you want to serve only some assets from your CDN, you can use custom :host
option for your asset helper, which overwrites the value set in
config.action_controller.asset_host.

```ruby
<%= asset_path 'image.png', host: 'mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com' %>
```

A CDN works by caching content. If the CDN has stale or bad content, then it is
hurting rather than helping your application. The purpose of this section is to
describe general caching behavior of most CDNs. Your specific provider may
behave slightly differently.

CDN Request Caching

While a CDN is described as being good for caching assets, it actually caches
the entire request. This includes the body of the asset as well as any headers.
The most important one being Cache-Control, which tells the CDN (and web
browsers) how to cache contents. This means that if someone requests an asset
that does not exist, such as /assets/i-dont-exist.png, and your Rails
application returns a 404, then your CDN will likely cache the 404 page if a
valid Cache-Control header is present.

CDN Header Debugging

One way to check the headers are cached properly in your CDN is by using curl. You
can request the headers from both your server and your CDN to verify they are
the same:

```bash
$ curl -I http://www.example/assets/application-
d0e099e021c95eb0de3615fd1d8c4d83.css
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Cowboy

Content-Type: text/css
Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000
Content-Length: 126560
Via: 1.1 vegur
```

Versus the CDN copy:

```bash
$ curl -I http://mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com/application-
d0e099e021c95eb0de3615fd1d8c4d83.css
HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: Cowboy Last-

```

Check your CDN documentation for any additional information they may provide
such as X-Cache or for any additional headers they may add.

CDNs and the Cache-Control Header

The Cache-Control header describes how a request can be cached. When no
CDN is used, a browser will use this information to cache contents. This is very
helpful for assets that are not modified so that a browser does not need to
re-download a website's CSS or JavaScript on every request. Generally we want
our Rails server to tell our CDN (and browser) that the asset is "public". That
means any cache can store the request. Also we commonly want to set max-age
which is how long the cache will store the object before invalidating the cache.
The max-age value is set to seconds with a maximum possible value of
31536000, which is one year. You can do this in your Rails application by
setting

```ruby
config.public_file_server.headers = {
  "Cache-Control" => "public, max-age=31536000"
}
```

Now when your application serves an asset in production, the CDN will store the
asset for up to a year. Since most CDNs also cache headers of the request, this
Cache-Control will be passed along to all future browsers seeking this asset.
The browser then knows that it can store this asset for a very long time before
needing to re-request it.

CDNs and URL-based Cache Invalidation

Most CDNs will cache contents of an asset based on the complete URL. This means
that a request to

```
http://mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com/assets/smile-123.png
```

Will be a completely different cache from

```
http://mycdnsubdomain.fictional-cdn.com/assets/smile.png
```

If you want to set far future max-age in your Cache-Control (and you do),
then make sure when you change your assets that your cache is invalidated. For
example when changing the smiley face in an image from yellow to blue, you want
all visitors of your site to get the new blue face. When using a CDN with the
Rails asset pipeline config.assets.digest is set to true by default so that
each asset will have a different file name when it is changed. This way you
don't have to ever manually invalidate any items in your cache. By using a
different unique asset name instead, your users get the latest asset.

## 4. Sprockets to Propshaft

### 4.1. Evolution of Asset Management Techniques

Within the last few years, the evolution of the web has led to significant
changes that have influenced how assets are managed in web applications. These
include:

- Browser Support: Modern browsers have improved support for new features
and syntax, reducing the need for transpilation and polyfills.

- HTTP/2: The introduction of HTTP/2 has made it easier to serve multiple
files in parallel, reducing the need for bundling.

- ES6+: Modern JavaScript syntax (ES6+) is supported by most modern
browsers, reducing the need for transpilation.

Therefore, the asset pipeline powered by Propshaft, no longer includes
transpilation, bundling, or compression by default. However, fingerprinting
still remains an integral part. You can read more about the evolution of asset
management techniques and how they directed the change from Sprockets to
Propshaft below.

#### 4.1.1. Transpilation ❌

Transpilation involves converting code from one language or format to another.

For example, converting TypeScript to JavaScript.

```
const greet = (name: string): void => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};
```

After transpilation, this code becomes:

```
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};
```

In the past, pre-processors like Sass and
Less were essential for CSS features such as variables
and nesting. Today, modern CSS supports these natively, reducing the need for
transpilation.

#### 4.1.2. Bundling ❌

Bundling combines multiple files into one to reduce the number of HTTP requests
a browser needs to make to render a page.

For example, if your application has three JavaScript files:

- menu.js

- cart.js

- checkout.js

Bundling will merge these into a single application.js file.

```
// app/javascript/application.js
// Contents of menu.js, cart.js, and checkout.js are combined here
```

This was crucial with HTTP/1.1, which limited 6-8 simultaneous connections per
domain. With HTTP/2, browsers fetch multiple files in parallel, making bundling
less critical for modern applications.

#### 4.1.3. Compression ❌

Compression encodes files in a more efficient format to reduce their size
further when delivered to users. A common technique is Gzip
compression.

For example, a CSS file that's 200KB may compress to just 50KB when Gzipped.
Browsers automatically decompress such files upon receipt, saving bandwidth and
improving speed.

However, with CDNs automatically compressing assets, the need for manual
compression has decreased.

### 4.2. Sprockets vs. Propshaft

#### 4.2.1. Load Order

In Sprockets, you could link files together to ensure they loaded in the correct
order. For example, a main JavaScript file that depended on other files would
automatically have its dependencies managed by Sprockets, ensuring everything
loaded in the right sequence. Propshaft, on the other hand, does not
automatically handle these dependencies, and instead lets you manage the asset
load order manually.

#### 4.2.2. Versioning

Sprockets simplifies asset fingerprinting by appending a hash to filenames
whenever assets are updated, ensuring proper cache invalidation. With Propshaft,
you’ll need to handle certain aspects manually. For example, while asset
fingerprinting works, you might need to use a bundler or trigger transformations
manually for JavaScript files to ensure filenames are updated correctly. Read
more about fingerprinting in
Propshaft.

#### 4.2.3. Precompilation

Sprockets processed assets that were explicitly included in a bundle. In
contrast, Propshaft automatically processes all assets located in the specified
paths, including images, stylesheets, JavaScript files, and more, without
requiring explicit bundling. Read more about asset
digesting.

### 4.3. Migration Steps

Propshaft is intentionally simpler than
Sprockets, which may make migrating
from Sprockets a fair amount of work. This is especially true if you rely on
Sprockets for tasks like transpiling
TypeScript or Sass,
or if you're using gems that provide this functionality. In such cases, you'll
either need to stop transpiling or switch to a Node.js-based transpiler, such as
those provided by
jsbundling-rails or
cssbundling-rails. Read more
about these in the Advanced Asset Management
section.

However, if you're already using a Node-based setup to bundle JavaScript and
CSS, Propshaft should integrate smoothly into your workflow. Since you won’t
need an additional tool for bundling or transpiling, Propshaft will primarily
handle asset digesting and serving.

Some key steps in the migration include:

- Remove some gems using the following:
bundle remove sprockets
bundle remove sprockets-rails
bundle remove sass-rails

- Delete the config/assets.rb and assets/config/manifest.js files from your
project.

- If you've already upgraded to Rails 8, then Propshaft is already included in
your application. Otherwise, install it using bundle add propshaft.

- Remove the config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join('app', 'assets') line
from your application.rb file.

- Migrate asset helpers by replacing all instances of asset helpers in your CSS
files (e.g., image_url) with standard url() functions, keeping in mind
that Propshaft utilizes relative paths.
For example, image_url("logo.png") may become url("/logo.png").

- If you're relying on Sprockets for transpiling, you'll need to switch to a
Node-based transpiler like Webpack, esbuild, or Vite. You can use the
jsbundling-rails and cssbundling-rails gems to integrate these tools into
your Rails application.

Remove some gems using the following:

```bash
bundle remove sprockets
bundle remove sprockets-rails
bundle remove sass-rails
```

Delete the config/assets.rb and assets/config/manifest.js files from your
project.

If you've already upgraded to Rails 8, then Propshaft is already included in
your application. Otherwise, install it using bundle add propshaft.

Remove the config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join('app', 'assets') line
from your application.rb file.

Migrate asset helpers by replacing all instances of asset helpers in your CSS
files (e.g., image_url) with standard url() functions, keeping in mind
that Propshaft utilizes relative paths.
For example, image_url("logo.png") may become url("/logo.png").

If you're relying on Sprockets for transpiling, you'll need to switch to a
Node-based transpiler like Webpack, esbuild, or Vite. You can use the
jsbundling-rails and cssbundling-rails gems to integrate these tools into
your Rails application.

For more information, you can read the detailed guide on how to migrate from
Sprockets to
Propshaft.

## 5. Advanced Asset Management

Over the years, there have been multiple default approaches for handling assets,
and as the web evolved, we began to see more JavaScript-heavy applications. In
The Rails Doctrine we believe that The Menu Is
Omakase, so Propshaft focuses on
delivering a production-ready setup with modern browsers by default.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution for the various JavaScript and CSS
frameworks and extensions available. However, there are other bundling libraries
in the Rails ecosystem that should empower you in cases where the default setup
isn't enough.

### 5.1. jsbundling-rails

jsbundling-rails is a gem that
integrates modern JavaScript bundlers into your Rails application. It allows you
to manage and bundle JavaScript assets with tools like Bun,
esbuild, rollup.js, or
Webpack, offering a runtime-dependent approach for
developers seeking flexibility and performance.

#### 5.1.1. How jsbundling-rails Works

- After installation, it sets up your Rails app to use your chosen JavaScript
bundler.

- It creates a build script in your package.json file to compile your
JavaScript assets.

- During development, the build:watch script ensures live updates to your
assets as you make changes.

- In production, the gem ensures that JavaScript is built and included during
the precompilation step, reducing manual intervention. It hooks into Rails'
assets:precompile task to build JavaScript for all entry points during
deployment. This integration ensures that your JavaScript is production-ready
with minimal configuration.

The gem automatically handles entry-point discovery - identifying the primary
JavaScript files to bundle by following Rails conventions, typically looking in
directories like app/javascript/ and configuration. By adhering to Rails
conventions, jsbundling-rails simplifies the process of integrating complex
JavaScript workflows into Rails projects.

#### 5.1.2. When Should You Use It?

jsbundling-rails is ideal for Rails applications that:

- Require modern JavaScript features like ES6+, TypeScript, or JSX.

- Need to leverage bundler-specific optimizations like tree-shaking, code
splitting, or minification.

- Use Propshaft for asset management and need a reliable way to integrate
precompiled JavaScript with the broader Rails asset pipeline.

- Utilize libraries or frameworks that depend on a build step. For example,
projects requiring transpilation—such as those using
Babel, TypeScript,
or React JSX—benefit greatly from jsbundling-rails. These tools rely on a
build step, which the gem seamlessly supports.

By integrating with Rails tools like Propshaft and simplifying JavaScript
workflows, jsbundling-rails allows you to build rich, dynamic front-ends while
staying productive and adhering to Rails conventions.

### 5.2. cssbundling-rails

cssbundling-rails integrates
modern CSS frameworks and tools into your Rails application. It allows you to
bundle and process your stylesheets. Once processed, the resulting CSS is
delivered via the Rails asset pipeline.

#### 5.2.1. How cssbundling-rails Works

- After installation, it sets up your Rails app to use your chosen CSS
framework or processor.

- It creates a build:css script in your package.json file to compile your
stylesheets.

- During development, a build:css --watch task ensures live updates to your
CSS as you make changes, providing a smooth and responsive workflow.

- In production, the gem ensures your stylesheets are compiled and ready for
deployment. During the assets:precompile step, it installs all
package.json dependencies via bun, yarn, pnpm or npm and runs the
build:css task to process your stylesheet entry points. The resulting CSS
output is then digested by the asset pipeline and copied into the
public/assets directory, just like other asset pipeline files.

This integration simplifies the process of preparing production-ready styles
while ensuring all your CSS is managed and processed efficiently.

#### 5.2.2. When Should You Use It?

cssbundling-rails is ideal for Rails applications that:

- Use CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS,
Bootstrap, or Bulma that
require processing during development or deployment.

- Need advanced CSS capabilities such as custom preprocessing with
PostCSS or Dart Sass
plugins.

- Require seamless integration of processed CSS into the Rails asset pipeline.

- Benefit from live updates to stylesheets during development with minimal
manual intervention.

NOTE: Unlike dartsass-rails or
tailwindcss-rails, which use
standalone versions of Dart Sass and Tailwind
CSS, cssbundling-rails introduces a Node.js
dependency. This makes it a good choice for applications already relying on Node
for JavaScript processing with gems like jsbundling-rails. However, if you're
using importmap-rails for
JavaScript and prefer to avoid Node.js, standalone alternatives like
dartsass-rails or
tailwindcss-rails offer a
simpler setup.

By integrating modern CSS workflows, automating production builds, and
leveraging the Rails asset pipeline, cssbundling-rails enables developers to
efficiently manage and deliver dynamic styles.

### 5.3. tailwindcss-rails

tailwindcss-rails is a wrapper
gem that integrates Tailwind CSS into your Rails
application. By bundling Tailwind CSS with a standalone
executable, it eliminates the need
for Node.js or additional JavaScript dependencies. This makes it a lightweight
and efficient solution for styling Rails applications.

#### 5.3.1. How tailwindcss-rails Works

- When installed, by providing --css tailwind to the rails new command, the
gem generates a tailwind.config.js file for customizing your Tailwind setup
and a stylesheets/application.tailwind.css file for managing your CSS entry
points.

- Instead of relying on Node.js, the gem uses a precompiled Tailwind CSS
binary. This standalone approach allows you to process and compile CSS
without adding a JavaScript runtime to your project.

- During development, changes to your Tailwind configuration or CSS files are
automatically detected and processed. The gem rebuilds your stylesheets and
provides a watch process to automatically generate Tailwind output in
development.

- In production, the gem hooks into the assets:precompile task. It processes
your Tailwind CSS files and generates optimized, production-ready
stylesheets, which are then included in the asset pipeline. The output is
fingerprinted and cached for efficient delivery.

#### 5.3.2. When Should You Use It?

tailwindcss-rails is ideal for Rails applications that:

- Want to use Tailwind CSS without introducing a
Node.js dependency or JavaScript build tools.

- Require a minimal setup for managing utility-first CSS frameworks.

- Need to take advantage of Tailwind's powerful features like custom themes,
variants, and plugins without complex configuration.

The gem works seamlessly with Rails' asset pipeline tools, like Propshaft,
ensuring that your CSS is preprocessed, digested, and efficiently served in
production environments.

### 5.4. importmap-rails

importmap-rails enables a
Node.js-free approach to managing JavaScript in Rails applications. It leverages
modern browser support for ES
Modules
to load JavaScript directly in the browser without requiring bundling or
transpilation. This approach aligns with Rails' commitment to simplicity and
convention over configuration.

#### 5.4.1. How importmap-rails Works

- After installation, importmap-rails configures your Rails app to use

<script type="module"> tags to load JavaScript modules directly in the
browser.

- JavaScript dependencies are managed using the bin/importmap command, which
pins modules to URLs, typically hosted on CDNs like
jsDelivr that host pre-bundled, browser-ready
versions of libraries. This eliminates the need for node_modules or a
package manager.

- During development, there’s no bundling step, so updates to your JavaScript
are instantly available, streamlining the workflow.

- In production, the gem integrates with Propshaft to serve JavaScript files as
part of the asset pipeline. Propshaft ensures files are digested, cached, and
production-ready. Dependencies are versioned, fingerprinted, and efficiently
delivered without manual intervention.

NOTE: While Propshaft ensures proper asset handling, it does not handle
JavaScript processing or transformations — importmap-rails assumes your
JavaScript is already in a browser-compatible format. This is why it works best
for projects that don't require transpiling or bundling.

By eliminating the need for a build step and Node.js, importmap-rails
simplifies JavaScript management.

#### 5.4.2. When Should You Use It?

importmap-rails is ideal for Rails applications that:

- Do not require complex JavaScript features like transpiling or bundling.

- Use modern JavaScript without relying on tools like
Babel.

# Chapters

This guide covers the options for integrating JavaScript functionality into your Rails application,
including the options you have for using external JavaScript packages and how to use Turbo with
Rails.

After reading this guide, you will know:

- How to use Rails without the need for a Node.js, Yarn, or a JavaScript bundler.

- How to create a new Rails application using import maps, Bun, esbuild, Rollup, or Webpack to bundle
your JavaScript.

- What Turbo is, and how to use it.

- [4. Turbo](#4-turbo)
- [5. Replacements for Rails/UJS Functionality](#5-replacements-for-railsujs-functionality)

## 1. Import Maps

Import maps let you import JavaScript modules using
logical names that map to versioned files directly from the browser. Import maps are the default
from Rails 7, allowing anyone to build modern JavaScript applications using most npm packages
without the need for transpiling or bundling.

Applications using import maps do not need Node.js or
Yarn to function. If you plan to use Rails with importmap-rails to
manage your JavaScript dependencies, there is no need to install Node.js or Yarn.

When using import maps, no separate build process is required, just start your server with
bin/rails server and you are good to go.

### 1.1. Installing importmap-rails

Importmap for Rails is automatically included in Rails 7+ for new applications, but you can also install it manually in existing applications:

```bash
$ bundle add importmap-rails
```

Run the install task:

```bash
$ bin/rails importmap:install
```

### 1.2. Adding npm Packages with importmap-rails

To add new packages to your import map-powered application, run the bin/importmap pin command
from your terminal:

```bash
$ bin/importmap pin react react-dom
```

Then, import the package into application.js as usual:

```
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
```

## 2. Adding npm Packages with JavaScript Bundlers

Import maps are the default for new Rails applications, but if you prefer traditional JavaScript
bundling, you can create new Rails applications with your choice of
Bun, esbuild,
Webpack, or Rollup.js.

To use a bundler instead of import maps in a new Rails application, pass the --javascript or -j
option to rails new:

```bash
$ rails new my_new_app --javascript=bun
OR
$ rails new my_new_app -j bun
```

These bundling options each come with a simple configuration and integration with the asset
pipeline via the jsbundling-rails gem.

When using a bundling option, use bin/dev to start the Rails server and build JavaScript for
development.

### 2.1. Installing a JavaScript Runtime

If you are using esbuild, Rollup.js, or Webpack to bundle your JavaScript in
your Rails application, Node.js and Yarn must be installed. If you are using
Bun, then you just need to install Bun as it is both a JavaScript runtime and a bundler.

#### 2.1.1. Installing Bun

Find the installation instructions at the Bun website and
verify it’s installed correctly and in your path with the following command:

```bash
$ bun --version
```

The version of your Bun runtime should be printed out. If it says something
like 1.0.0, Bun has been installed correctly.

If not, you may need to reinstall Bun in the current directory or restart your terminal.

#### 2.1.2. Installing Node.js and Yarn

If you are using esbuild, Rollup.js, or Webpack you will need Node.js and Yarn.

Find the installation instructions at the Node.js website and
verify it’s installed correctly with the following command:

```bash
$ node --version
```

The version of your Node.js runtime should be printed out. Make sure it’s greater than 8.16.0.

To install Yarn, follow the installation instructions at the
Yarn website. Running this command should print out
the Yarn version:

```bash
$ yarn --version
```

If it says something like 1.22.0, Yarn has been installed correctly.

## 3. Choosing Between Import Maps and a JavaScript Bundler

When you create a new Rails application, you will need to choose between import maps and a
JavaScript bundling solution. Every application has different requirements, and you should
consider your requirements carefully before choosing a JavaScript option, as migrating from one
option to another may be time-consuming for large, complex applications.

Import maps are the default option because the Rails team believes in import maps' potential for
reducing complexity, improving developer experience, and delivering performance gains.

For many applications, especially those that rely primarily on the Hotwire
stack for their JavaScript needs, import maps will be the right option for the long term. You
can read more about the reasoning behind making import maps the default in Rails 7
here.

Other applications may still need a traditional JavaScript bundler. Requirements that indicate
that you should choose a traditional bundler include:

- If your code requires a transpilation step, such as JSX or TypeScript.

- If you need to use JavaScript libraries that include CSS or otherwise rely on
Webpack loaders.

- If you are absolutely sure that you need
tree-shaking.

- If you will install Bootstrap, Bulma, PostCSS, or Dart CSS through the cssbundling-rails gem. All options provided by this gem except Tailwind and Sass will automatically install esbuild for you if you do not specify a different option in rails new.

## 4. Turbo

Whether you choose import maps or a traditional bundler, Rails ships with
Turbo to speed up your application while dramatically reducing the
amount of JavaScript that you will need to write.

Turbo lets your server deliver HTML directly as an alternative to the prevailing front-end
frameworks that reduce the server-side of your Rails application to little more than a JSON API.

### 4.1. Turbo Drive

Turbo Drive speeds up page loads by avoiding full-page
teardowns and rebuilds on every navigation request. Turbo Drive is an improvement on and
replacement for Turbolinks.

### 4.2. Turbo Frames

Turbo Frames allow predefined parts of a page to be
updated on request, without impacting the rest of the page’s content.

You can use Turbo Frames to build in-place editing without any custom JavaScript, lazy load
content, and create server-rendered, tabbed interfaces with ease.

Rails provides HTML helpers to simplify the use of Turbo Frames through the
turbo-rails gem.

Using this gem, you can add a Turbo Frame to your application with the turbo_frame_tag helper
like this:

```ruby
<%= turbo_frame_tag dom_id(post) do %>
  <div>
     <%= link_to post.title, post_path(post) %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

### 4.3. Turbo Streams

Turbo Streams deliver page changes as fragments of
HTML wrapped in self-executing <turbo-stream> elements. Turbo Streams allow you to broadcast
changes made by other users over WebSockets and update pieces of a page after a form submission
without requiring a full page load.

Rails provides HTML and server-side helpers to simplify the use of Turbo Streams through the
turbo-rails gem.

Using this gem, you can render Turbo Streams from a controller action:

```ruby
def create
  @post = Post.new(post_params)

  respond_to do |format|
    if @post.save
      format.turbo_stream
    else
      format.html { render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end
```

Rails will automatically look for a .turbo_stream.erb view file and render that view when found.

Turbo Stream responses can also be rendered inline in the controller action:

```ruby
def create
  @post = Post.new(post_params)

  respond_to do |format|
    if @post.save
      format.turbo_stream { render turbo_stream: turbo_stream.prepend("posts", partial: "post") }
    else
      format.html { render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end
```

Finally, Turbo Streams can be initiated from a model or a background job using built-in helpers.
These broadcasts can be used to update content via a WebSocket connection to all users, keeping
page content fresh and bringing your application to life.

To broadcast a Turbo Stream from a model, combine a model callback like this:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  after_create_commit { broadcast_append_to("posts") }
end
```

With a WebSocket connection set up on the page that should receive the updates like this:

```ruby
<%= turbo_stream_from "posts" %>
```

## 5. Replacements for Rails/UJS Functionality

Rails 6 shipped with a tool called UJS (Unobtrusive JavaScript). UJS allows
developers to override the HTTP request method of <a> tags, to add confirmation
dialogs before executing an action, and more. UJS was the default before Rails
7, but it is now recommended to use Turbo instead.

### 5.1. Method

Clicking links always results in an HTTP GET request. If your application is
RESTful, some links are in fact
actions that change data on the server, and should be performed with non-GET
requests. The data-turbo-method attribute allows marking up such links with
an explicit method such as "post", "put", or "delete".

Turbo will scan <a> tags in your application for the turbo-method data attribute and use the
specified method when present, overriding the default GET action.

For example:

```ruby
<%= link_to "Delete post", post_path(post), data: { turbo_method: "delete" } %>
```

This generates:

```html
<a data-turbo-method="delete" href="...">Delete post</a>
```

An alternative to changing the method of a link with data-turbo-method is to use Rails
button_to helper. For accessibility reasons, actual buttons and forms are preferable for any
non-GET action.

### 5.2. Confirmations

You can ask for an extra confirmation from the user by adding a data-turbo-confirm
attribute on links and forms. On link click or form submit, the user will be
presented with a JavaScript confirm() dialog containing the attribute's text.
If the user chooses to cancel, the action doesn't take place.

For example, with the link_to helper:

```ruby
<%= link_to "Delete post", post_path(post), data: { turbo_method: "delete", turbo_confirm: "Are you sure?" } %>
```

Which generates:

```html
<a href="..." data-turbo-confirm="Are you sure?" data-turbo-method="delete">Delete post</a>
```

When the user clicks on the "Delete post" link, they will be presented with an
"Are you sure?" confirmation dialog.

The attribute can also be used with the button_to helper, however it must be
added to the form that the button_to helper renders internally:

```ruby
<%= button_to "Delete post", post, method: :delete, form: { data: { turbo_confirm: "Are you sure?" } } %>
```

### 5.3. Ajax Requests

When making non-GET requests from JavaScript, the X-CSRF-Token header is required.
Without this header, requests won't be accepted by Rails.

This token is required by Rails to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Read more in the security guide.

Rails Request.JS encapsulates the logic
of adding the request headers that are required by Rails. Just
import the FetchRequest class from the package and instantiate it
passing the request method, url, options, then call await request.perform()
and do what you need with the response.

For example:

```
import { FetchRequest } from '@rails/request.js'

....

async myMethod () {
  const request = new FetchRequest('post', 'localhost:3000/posts', {
    body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'Request.JS' })
  })
  const response = await request.perform()
  if (response.ok) {
    const body = await response.text
  }
}
```

When using another library to make Ajax calls, it is necessary to add the
security token as a default header yourself. To get the token, have a look at
<meta name='csrf-token' content='THE-TOKEN'> tag printed by
csrf_meta_tags in your application view. You could do something like:

```
document.head.querySelector("meta[name=csrf-token]")?.content
```

This guide provides you with all you need to get started in handling rich text
content.

After reading this guide, you will know:

- What Action Text is, and how to install and configure it.

- How to create, render, style, and customize rich text content.

- How to handle attachments.

## Table of Contents

- [6. Attachments](#6-attachments)
- [7. Miscellaneous](#7-miscellaneous)

## 1. What is Action Text?

Action Text facilitates the handling and display of rich text content. Rich text
content is text that includes formatting elements such as bold, italics, colors,
and hyperlinks, providing a visually enhanced and structured presentation beyond
plain text. It allows us to create rich text content, store it in a table, then
attach it to any of our models.

Action Text includes a WYSIWYG editor
called Trix, which is used in web applications to provide users with a
user-friendly interface for creating and editing rich text content. It handles
everything from providing enriching capabilities like the formatting of text,
adding links or quotes, embedding images, and much much more. See the Trix
editor website for examples.

The rich text content generated by the Trix editor is saved in its own RichText
model that can be associated with any existing Active Record model in the
application. In addition, any embedded images (or other attachments) can be
automatically stored using Active Storage (which is added as a dependency) and
associated with that RichText model. When it's time to render content, Action
Text processes the content by sanitizing it first so that it's safe to embed
directly into the page's HTML.

Most WYSIWYG editors are wrappers around HTML’s contenteditable and
execCommand APIs. These APIs were designed by Microsoft to support live
editing of web pages in Internet Explorer 5.5. They were eventually
reverse-engineered and copied by other browsers. Consequently, these APIs were
never fully specified or documented, and because WYSIWYG HTML editors are
enormous in scope, each browser's implementation has its own set of bugs and
quirks. Hence, JavaScript developers are often left to resolve the
inconsistencies. Trix sidesteps these inconsistencies by treating
contenteditable as an I/O device: when input makes its way to the editor, Trix
converts that input into an editing operation on its internal document model,
then re-renders that document back into the editor. This gives Trix complete
control over what happens after every keystroke and avoids the need to use
execCommand and the inconsistencies that come along with it.

## 2. Installation

To install Action Text and start working with rich text content, run:

```bash
$ bin/rails action_text:install
```

It will do the following:

- Installs the JavaScript packages for trix and @rails/actiontext and adds
them to the application.js.

- Adds the image_processing gem for analysis and transformations of the
embedded images and other attachments with Active Storage. Please refer to the
Active Storage Overview guide for more
information about it.

- Adds migrations to create the following tables that store rich text content
and attachments: action_text_rich_texts, active_storage_blobs,
active_storage_attachments, active_storage_variant_records.

- Creates actiontext.css which includes all Trix styles and overrides.

- Adds the default view partials _content.html and _blob.html to render
Action Text content and Active Storage attachment (aka blob) respectively.

Thereafter, executing the migrations will add the new action_text_* and
active_storage_* tables to your app:

```bash
$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

When the Action Text installation creates the action_text_rich_texts table, it
uses a polymorphic relationship so that multiple models can add rich text
attributes. This is done through the record_type and record_id columns,
which store the ClassName of the model, and ID of the record, respectively.

With polymorphic associations, a model can belong to more than one other
model, on a single association. Read more about it in the Active Record
Associations
guide.

Hence, if your models containing Action Text content use UUID values as
identifiers, then all models that use Action Text attributes will need to use
UUID values for their unique identifiers. The generated migration for Action
Text will also need to be updated to specify type: :uuid for the record
references line.

```ruby
t.references :record, null: false, polymorphic: true, index: false, type: :uuid
```

## 3. Creating Rich Text Content

This section explores some of the configurations you'll need to follow to create
rich text.

The RichText record holds the content produced by the Trix editor in a
serialized body attribute. It also holds all the references to the embedded
files, which are stored using Active Storage. This record is then associated
with the Active Record model which desires to have rich text content. The
association is made by placing the has_rich_text class method in the model
that you’d like to add rich text to.

```ruby
# app/models/article.rb
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  has_rich_text :content
end
```

There's no need to add the content column to your Article table.
has_rich_text associates the content with the action_text_rich_texts table
that has been created, and links it back to your model. You also may choose to
name the attribute to be something different from content.

Once you have added the has_rich_text class method to the model, you can then
update your views to make use of the rich text editor (Trix) for that field. To
do so, use a
rich_textarea
for the form field.

```ruby
<%# app/views/articles/_form.html.erb %>
<%= form_with model: article do |form| %>
  <div class="field">
    <%= form.label :content %>
    <%= form.rich_textarea :content %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

This will display a Trix editor that provides the functionality to create and
update your rich text accordingly. Later we'll go into details about how to
update the styles for the
editor.

Finally, to ensure that you can accept updates from the editor, you will need to
permit the referenced attribute as a parameter in the relevant controller:

```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def create
    article = Article.create! params.expect(article: [:title, :content])
    redirect_to article
  end
end
```

If the need arises to rename classes that utilize has_rich_text, you will also
need to update the polymorphic type column record_type in the
action_text_rich_texts table for the respective rows.

Since Action Text depends on polymorphic associations, which, in turn, involve
storing class names in the database, it's crucial to keep the data in sync with
the class names used in your Ruby code. This synchronization is essential to
maintain consistency between the stored data and the class references in your
codebase.

## 4. Rendering Rich Text Content

Instances of ActionText::RichText can be directly embedded into a page because
they have already sanitized their content for a safe render. You can display the
content as follows:

```ruby
<%= @article.content %>
```

ActionText::RichText#to_s safely transforms RichText into an HTML String. On
the other hand ActionText::RichText#to_plain_text returns a string that is not
HTML safe and should not be rendered in browsers without additional sanitization.
You can learn more about Action Text's sanitization process in the ActionText::RichText
documentation.

If there's an attached resource within content field, it might not show
properly unless you have the necessary dependencies for Active
Storage installed.

## 5. Customizing the Rich Text Content Editor (Trix)

There may be times when you want to update the presentation of the editor to
meet your stylistic requirements, this section guides on how to do that.

### 5.1. Removing or Adding Trix Styles

By default, Action Text will render rich text content inside an element with the
.trix-content class. This is set in
app/views/layouts/action_text/contents/_content.html.erb.  Elements with this
class are then styled by the trix stylesheet.

If you’d like to update any of the trix styles, you can add your custom styles
in app/assets/stylesheets/actiontext.css, which includes both the full set of
styles for Trix and the overrides needed for Action Text.

### 5.2. Customizing the Editor Container

To customize the HTML container element that's rendered around rich text
content, edit the app/views/layouts/action_text/contents/_content.html.erb
layout file created by the installer:

```ruby
<%# app/views/layouts/action_text/contents/_content.html.erb %>
<div class="trix-content">
  <%= yield %>
</div>
```

### 5.3. Customizing HTML for Embedded Images and Attachments

To customize the HTML rendered for embedded images and other attachments (known
as blobs), edit the app/views/active_storage/blobs/_blob.html.erb template
created by the installer:

```ruby
<%# app/views/active_storage/blobs/_blob.html.erb %>
<figure class="attachment attachment--<%= blob.representable? ? "preview" : "file" %> attachment--<%= blob.filename.extension %>">
  <% if blob.representable? %>
    <%= image_tag blob.representation(resize_to_limit: local_assigns[:in_gallery] ? [ 800, 600 ] : [ 1024, 768 ]) %>
  <% end %>

  <figcaption class="attachment__caption">
    <% if caption = blob.try(:caption) %>
      <%= caption %>
    <% else %>
      <span class="attachment__name"><%= blob.filename %></span>
      <span class="attachment__size"><%= number_to_human_size blob.byte_size %></span>
    <% end %>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

## 6. Attachments

Currently, Action Text supports attachments that are uploaded through Active
Storage as well as attachments that are linked to a Signed GlobalID.

### 6.1. Active Storage

When uploading an image within your rich text editor, it uses Action Text which
in turn uses Active Storage. However, Active Storage has some
dependencies which are not provided
by Rails. To use the built-in previewers, you must install these libraries.

Some, but not all of these libraries are required and they are dependent on the
kind of uploads you are expecting within the editor. A common error that users
encounter when working with Action Text and Active Storage is that images do not
render correctly in the editor. This is usually due to the libvips dependency
not being installed.

#### 6.1.1. Attachment Direct Upload JavaScript Events

Action Text dispatches Active Storage Direct Upload
Events during the
File attachment lifecycle.

In addition to the typical event.detail properties, Action Text also
dispatches events with an
event.detail.attachment
property.

It is possible for files uploaded by Action Text through Active Storage
Direct Uploads to never be
embedded within rich text content. Consider purging unattached
uploads regularly.

### 6.2. Signed GlobalID

In addition to attachments uploaded through Active Storage, Action Text can also
embed anything that can be resolved by a Signed
GlobalID.

A Global ID is an app-wide URI that uniquely identifies a model instance:
gid://YourApp/Some::Model/id. This is helpful when you need a single
identifier to reference different classes of objects.

When using this method, Action Text requires attachments to have a signed global
ID (sgid). By default, all Active Record models in a Rails app mix in the
GlobalID::Identification concern, so they can be resolved by a signed global
ID and are therefore ActionText::Attachable compatible.

Action Text references the HTML you insert on save so that it can re-render with
up-to-date content later on. This makes it so that you can reference models and
always display the current content when those records change.

Action Text will load up the model from the global ID and then render it with
the default partial path when you render the content.

An Action Text Attachment can look like this:

```html
<action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCG…"></action-text-attachment>
```

Action Text renders embedded <action-text-attachment> elements by resolving
their sgid attribute of the element into an instance. Once resolved, that
instance is passed along to a render helper. As a result, the HTML is embedded
as a descendant of the <action-text-attachment> element.

To be rendered within Action Text <action-text-attachment> element as an
attachment, we must include the ActionText::Attachable module, which
implements #to_sgid(**options) (made available through the
GlobalID::Identification concern).

You can also optionally declare #to_attachable_partial_path to render a custom
partial path and #to_missing_attachable_partial_path for handling missing
records.

An example can be found here:

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  include ActionText::Attachable
end

person = Person.create! name: "Javan"
html = %Q(<action-text-attachment sgid="#{person.attachable_sgid}"></action-text-attachment>)
content = ActionText::Content.new(html)
content.attachables # => [person]
```

### 6.3. Rendering an Action Text Attachment

The default way that an <action-text-attachment> is rendered is through the
default path partial.

To illustrate this further, let’s consider a User model:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :avatar
end

user = User.find(1)
user.to_global_id.to_s #=> gid://MyRailsApp/User/1
user.to_signed_global_id.to_s #=> BAh7CEkiCG…
```

We can mix GlobalID::Identification into any model with a .find(id)
class method. Support is automatically included in Active Record.

The above code will return our identifier to uniquely identify a model instance.

Next, consider some rich text content that embeds an <action-text-attachment>
element that references the User instance's signed GlobalID:

```html
<p>Hello, <action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCG…"></action-text-attachment>.</p>
```

Action Text uses the "BAh7CEkiCG…" String to resolve the User instance. It then
renders it with the default partial path when you render the content.

In this case, the default partial path is the users/user partial:

```ruby
<%# app/views/users/_user.html.erb %>
<span><%= image_tag user.avatar %> <%= user.name %></span>
```

Hence, the resulting HTML rendered by Action Text would look something like:

```html
<p>Hello, <action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCG…"><span><img src="..."> Jane Doe</span></action-text-attachment>.</p>
```

### 6.4. Rendering a Different Partial for the action-text-attachment

To render a different partial for the attachable, define
User#to_attachable_partial_path:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def to_attachable_partial_path
    "users/attachable"
  end
end
```

Then declare that partial. The User instance will be available as the user
partial-local variable:

```ruby
<%# app/views/users/_attachable.html.erb %>
<span><%= image_tag user.avatar %> <%= user.name %></span>
```

### 6.5. Rendering a Partial for an Unresolved Instance or Missing action-text-attachment

If Action Text is unable to resolve the User instance (for example, if the
record has been deleted), then a default fallback partial will be rendered.

To render a different missing attachment partial, define a class-level
to_missing_attachable_partial_path method:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def self.to_missing_attachable_partial_path
    "users/missing_attachable"
  end
end
```

Then declare that partial.

```ruby
<%# app/views/users/missing_attachable.html.erb %>
<span>Deleted user</span>
```

### 6.6. Attachable via API

If your architecture does not follow the traditional Rails server-side rendered
pattern, then you may perhaps find yourself with a backend API (for example,
using JSON) that will need a separate endpoint for uploading files. The endpoint
will be required to create an ActiveStorage::Blob and return its
attachable_sgid:

```
{
  "attachable_sgid": "BAh7CEkiCG…"
}
```

Thereafter, you can take the attachable_sgid and insert it in rich text
content within your frontend code using the <action-text-attachment> tag:

```html
<action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCG…"></action-text-attachment>
```

## 7. Miscellaneous

### 7.1. Avoiding N+1 Queries

If you wish to preload the dependent ActionText::RichText model, assuming your
rich text field is named content, you can use the named scope:

```ruby
Article.all.with_rich_text_content # Preload the body without attachments.
Article.all.with_rich_text_content_and_embeds # Preload both body and attachments.
```
