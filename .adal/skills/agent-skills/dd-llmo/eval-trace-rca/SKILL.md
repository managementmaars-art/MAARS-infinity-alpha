# Eval RCA — Root Cause Analysis from Production Eval Signal

Perform structured root cause analysis on production LLM traces using LLM judge verdicts and reasoning. The goal is to diagnose **why the user's application is failing** — not to evaluate the judge itself. The judge is the signal; the app is the patient.

## Methodology

**Context → Observe → Open Coding → Axial Coding → Root Cause Analysis → Recommendations**

## Usage

```
What's wrong with <ml_app> based on its evals over the last <timeframe>
Analyze eval failures for <eval_name> over the last <timeframe>
```

### Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ml_app` | One of these | — | The application to analyze. The skill discovers all configured evals via `list_llmobs_evals`. |
| `eval_name` | One of these | — | A specific evaluator to focus on. Eval names are unique per org — each eval belongs to exactly one `ml_app`. |
| `timeframe` | No | `now-24h` | How far back to look |

Either `ml_app` or `eval_name` must be provided. If neither is given, ask the user.

## Available Tools

### Eval Discovery & Overview

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_llmobs_evals` | Discover all configured evals for an `ml_app`. Returns eval names and types. Use when starting from `ml_app`. |
| `get_llmobs_eval_aggregate_stats` | Pass/fail rate, score distribution, or categorical breakdown for an eval over a time window. |
| `get_llmobs_eval_config` | Custom eval's prompt template, assessment criteria, output schema. Returns nil for OOTB evals. |

### Trace & Span Exploration

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `search_llmobs_spans` | Find spans by eval presence, tags, span kind, query syntax. Paginate with cursor. |
| `get_llmobs_span_details` | Metadata, evaluations (scores, labels, reasoning), and **`content_info`** map showing available fields + sizes. |
| `get_llmobs_span_content` | Actual content for a span field. Supports JSONPath via `path` param for targeted extraction. |
| `get_llmobs_trace` | Full trace hierarchy as span tree with span counts by kind. |
| `find_llmobs_error_spans` | All error spans in a trace with error type, message, stack, and propagation context. |
| `expand_llmobs_spans` | Load children of collapsed trace nodes. |
| `get_llmobs_agent_loop` | Chronological agent execution timeline (LLM calls, tool invocations, decisions). |

### Key `get_llmobs_span_content` Patterns

Use the `path` parameter to extract targeted data without fetching full payloads:

| Field | Path | What you get |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `messages` | `$.messages[0]` | System prompt (first message, usually `system` role) |
| `messages` | `$.messages[-1]` | Last assistant response |
| `messages` | *(no path)* | Full conversation including tool calls |
| `input` / `output` | — | Span I/O |
| `documents` | — | Retrieved documents (RAG apps) |
| `metadata` | — | Custom metadata (prompt versions, feature flags, user segments) |

### How to Use `search_llmobs_spans`

**Primary query pattern** — eval presence:

```
@evaluations.custom.<eval_name>:*
```

You can only query for eval *presence*, not specific results (e.g., `@evaluation_assessments.custom.<name>:fail` will NOT work). To determine pass vs fail, read the verdict from `get_llmobs_span_details`.

Additional filters combine with space (AND): `@evaluations.custom.<name>:* @status:ok`. Dedicated params (`span_kind`, `root_spans_only`, `ml_app`) work alongside `query`, but `query` takes precedence over `tags`.

### Parallelization Rules

1. **`get_llmobs_span_details`**: Group span_ids by trace_id. One call per trace_id with ALL its span_ids. Issue ALL calls for a page in a **single message**.
2. **`get_llmobs_span_content`**: Each call is independent — always issue ALL in a single message.
3. **`get_llmobs_trace` / `find_llmobs_error_spans` / `get_llmobs_agent_loop`**: Parallelize across different traces in a single message.
4. **Pipeline parallelism**: Start `get_llmobs_span_details` for page 1 results immediately — don't wait to collect all pages.

---

## Analysis Workflow

**Output discipline**: Phases 0–5 are internal analysis. The only user-facing outputs during these phases are the brief checkpoint updates (Phases 2, 3) and the Eval Overview (Phase 1a). Do NOT narrate your reasoning, summarize intermediate findings, or output Phase 4 deep-dive results as prose. All detailed findings go exclusively into the Phase 6 report.

---

### Phase 0: Resolve Inputs

1. If neither `ml_app` nor `eval_name` provided → ask the user.
2. If `timeframe` not provided → default to `now-24h`.
3. **ml_app entry point**: If `ml_app` provided without `eval_name`, call `list_llmobs_evals(ml_app)` to discover all configured evals. Then call `get_llmobs_eval_aggregate_stats` for each eval (in parallel) to get a quick health snapshot. Present the overview to the user and proceed to analyze ALL evals with issues (don't ask the user to pick one).
4. **eval_name entry point**: Proceed directly to Phase 1 for the specified eval.
5. Note any additional filters (tags, span_kind) for all subsequent queries.

---

### Phase 1: Gather Context & Collect Evidence

**Goal**: Get the big picture, sample failure spans, and determine the app profile.

#### Step 1a: Eval overview (parallel)

For each eval being analyzed, call both in parallel:

- `get_llmobs_eval_aggregate_stats(eval_name, from, to)`
- `get_llmobs_eval_config(eval_name)`

When analyzing multiple evals (ml_app entry point), issue ALL calls for all evals in a single parallel batch.

**Interpret aggregate stats:**

- **`total_count == 0`** → Note "no data." Skip this eval.
- **Boolean with `pass_rate == 1.0`** → Note "100% pass." Skip unless it's the only eval.
- **Boolean with failures** → Note counts and pass_rate. Continue.
- **Score eval with assessment criteria** → Note distribution and pass/fail counts. Continue.
- **Score eval WITHOUT assessment criteria** → Still analyze. Use score distribution to identify low-performers: treat bottom quartile as "failures," or scores below the median if the distribution is bimodal. Note that the threshold is inferred, not configured.
- **Categorical with assessment criteria** → Note top_values and pass/fail. Continue.
- **Categorical WITHOUT assessment criteria** → Still analyze. Examine the value distribution. Ask user which categories represent failures if ambiguous, or infer from context (e.g., "error", "incomplete", "off_topic" are likely failures).

**Interpret eval config:**

- **Config returned** (custom/BYOP) → Store `prompt_template`, `assessment_criteria`, `parsing_type`, `output_schema`.
- **Config nil** (OOTB) → Note prompt is not inspectable.

**Report to user:**

```
## Eval Overview: `{eval_name}`

**Timeframe**: {from} → {to}  |  **Type**: {boolean/score/categorical}  |  **Eval**: {Custom/OOTB}
**Total spans**: {total_count}  |  **Pass rate**: {pass_rate}% ({pass_count}/{fail_count})
{If no assessment criteria: **Note**: No pass/fail criteria configured. Using inferred threshold: {threshold_description}.}

{If custom: 1-2 sentence summary of what the eval measures.}
```

When multiple evals are being analyzed, present a combined overview table first:

```
## Eval Overview: `{ml_app}`

| Eval | Type | Total | Pass Rate | Status |
|------|------|------:|:---------:|--------|
| eval_1 | boolean | 4,891 | 37.3% | ⚠ Investigating |
| eval_2 | score | 1,200 | — (no criteria) | ⚠ Investigating (inferred threshold) |
| eval_3 | boolean | 500 | 99.2% | ✓ Healthy |
```

#### Step 1b: Collect failure spans

For each eval being analyzed:

1. `search_llmobs_spans(query="@evaluations.custom.<eval_name>:*", from, limit=50)` + user filters.
   - Paginate until ≥15–20 failures OR no more pages. Cap at 200 spans total per eval.

2. `get_llmobs_span_details` per trace_id batch (follow Parallelization Rules).
   - Extract: **assessment**, **value**, **reasoning**, **span_id**, **trace_id**, **span_kind**, **content_info**.

3. Separate into pass/fail buckets.
   - **With assessment criteria**: Use configured pass/fail threshold.
   - **Without assessment criteria**: Use the inferred threshold from Step 1a (bottom quartile for scores, inferred categories for categorical). Label these as "inferred failures" in the report.

4. Report: `Collected {N} spans for {eval_name}: {pass_count} passing, {fail_count} failing.`

5. Edge cases: 0 failures in sample → try different time slice. < 10 failures → proceed, note low confidence.

#### Step 1c: Determine App Profile & Eval Scope

Inspect `content_info` and `span_kind` across collected spans. This drives the Phase 4 investigation strategy.

**App profile** (from content_info):

| Signal | App profile | Phase 4 strategy |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| `content_info` has `messages` | LLM/chat app | Extract system prompt via `messages[0]`, check conversation flow |
| `content_info` has `documents` | RAG app | Check retrieval quality alongside LLM output |
| Trace contains `agent` span kind | Agent app | Use `get_llmobs_agent_loop` for decision tracing, analyze tool usage |
| `messages.count > 10` | Long conversation | Check for context overflow |
| `content_info` has `metadata` | Has custom metadata | Check for clustering by metadata values (prompt version, etc.) |

**Evaluated span kind** — determines where the root cause likely lives:

| Eval runs on... | Symptom surfaces here | But root cause is often in... |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| `llm` span | Bad LLM response | **Parent** agent (bad instructions), **sibling** retrieval (bad context), **sibling** tool (bad data fed to LLM) |
| `agent` span | Bad orchestration | **Child** spans (wrong tool calls, bad routing), full agent loop |
| `tool` span | Bad tool result | **Parent** LLM (passed wrong parameters), tool implementation |
| `workflow` span | Bad overall output | **Child** sub-spans (which step first deviated?) |
| `retrieval` span | Bad retrieval | Query construction (parent), index/embedding config (outside trace) |

**Key insight**: The eval judges a single span in isolation. The judge reasoning is a *symptom report*, not a diagnosis. The root cause often lives in a different span in the same trace — a parent that gave bad instructions, a sibling that provided bad context, or a child that made a wrong decision. Phase 4 must navigate the trace tree to find it.

---

### Phase 2: Open Coding — Initial Failure Categorization

**Goal**: Read failure evidence and propose initial, concrete failure categories. When analyzing multiple evals, pool all failures together — categories should describe app behaviors, not which eval caught them. Note which eval(s) flagged each category.

**Shortcuts**:

- **< 15 failures**: Combine Phases 2 and 3 into one pass. Still produce the checkpoint output.
- **> 80% share the same reasoning**: Skip to Phase 4 with dominant pattern. Still output checkpoint.
- **> 50 failures**: Sample ~50, build taxonomy, then spot-check 10–15 more.

1. **Use reasoning from Step 1b** — do NOT re-fetch.
   - Only call `get_span_content(field="input"/"output")` for spans where reasoning is insufficient (generic or empty).

2. **If eval config loaded**, distinguish early:
   - **App failures**: Output genuinely violates the eval's criteria
   - **Eval failures**: Output seems reasonable but eval criteria are too strict/ambiguous

3. **Each pattern must be specific**: "Agent called search instead of calculator for price computation" — NOT "tool issue."

#### MANDATORY CHECKPOINT — Brief Progress Update

**You MUST output a brief summary before proceeding.** Keep it short — the full report in Phase 6 is the real deliverable. No descriptions or examples here.

```
**Open coding**: {N} failures → {K} initial categories: {Category1} ({count}), {Category2} ({count}), ...
```

---

### Phase 3: Axial Coding — Refine Failure Taxonomy

**Goal**: 3–8 final categories, ranked by impact.

1. **Merge**: Categories with < 3 occurrences → parent category or drop as noise.
2. **Split**: Categories with > 30% of failures → more specific sub-categories. Pull additional span content if needed.
3. **Validate**: 2–3 representative examples per category confirm the label fits.
4. **Rank**: `priority = count × severity` (severity: high / medium / low).

#### MANDATORY CHECKPOINT — Brief Progress Update

**You MUST output the refined taxonomy before proceeding.** Keep it short — show what changed and the ranked list. Details go in the final report.

```
**Axial coding**: {merges/splits/drops}. Final categories:
1. {Category} ({count}, {pct}%) — {severity}
2. ...
```

---

### Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis — Navigate from Symptom to Root Cause

**Goal**: The eval flagged a span. That's the symptom. Now find the actual root cause by navigating the trace tree — it's often in a different span.

For each of the top 3 categories, pick 2–3 representative traces:

#### Step 4a: Trace structure + errors (parallel)

For each representative trace, call in a single message:

- `get_trace(trace_id)` — get span hierarchy; locate the evaluated span and its parent/siblings/children
- `find_error_spans(trace_id)` — check for runtime errors anywhere in the trace

**Runtime vs behavioral**: If `find_llmobs_error_spans` returns errors on the evaluated span or nearby spans, the root cause may be a runtime failure (timeout, API error) rather than a behavioral one. Check this first.

#### Step 4b: Navigate to the root cause (parallel)

Use the evaluated span kind (from Step 1c) to decide where to look. Issue ALL calls in a single message.

**If eval is on an `llm` span** (most common):

- `get_span_content(field="messages", path="$.messages[0]")` on the **evaluated span** — get its system prompt
- `get_span_content(field="messages")` on the **evaluated span** — check what context it received
- `get_span_content(field="documents")` on **sibling retrieval spans** (if any) — was the retrieved context relevant?
- `get_span_content(field="input")` on **sibling tool spans** (if any) — did tools provide good data?
- `get_span_content(field="messages", path="$.messages[0]")` on **parent agent/workflow span** — did the parent give clear instructions?

**If eval is on an `agent` span**:

- `get_agent_loop(trace_id, span_id)` — full decision timeline
- `get_llmobs_span_details` on **child spans** — which tool/LLM calls did the agent make?
- `get_span_content(field="input"/"output")` on **child spans that look wrong** — what went off track?

**If eval is on a `tool` span**:

- `get_span_content(field="input")` on the **evaluated span** — what parameters was it called with?
- `get_span_content(field="messages")` on the **parent LLM span** — did the LLM construct the call correctly?

**If eval is on a `workflow` span**:

- `get_llmobs_span_details` on **all child spans** — find which step first deviated from expected behavior
- `get_span_content(field="input"/"output")` on the **deviating child** — what went wrong?

**Always also fetch**:

- `get_span_content(field="metadata")` on the evaluated span — check for clustering signals (prompt version, feature flags)

#### Step 4c: Diagnose — from symptom to root cause

For each category, trace the causal chain:

1. **Symptom** — what the judge flagged (reasoning from Phase 1b). Remember: the judge only saw one span's input/output, so its reasoning may be shallow.
2. **Trace context** — what the surrounding spans reveal (parent instructions, sibling data, child decisions)
3. **Root cause** — the specific span and decision point where the failure originated. This is often NOT the evaluated span itself.

**For suspected eval issues** (if config loaded): Compare the eval's criteria against evidence. Is the prompt ambiguous? Criteria too strict?

**Root cause categories:**

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **System Prompt Deficiency** | Instructions unclear, missing, or contradictory — in evaluated span OR its parent |
| **Tool Gap** | Needed tool doesn't exist or parameters too coarse |
| **Tool Misuse** | Wrong tool called or wrong parameters — often visible in agent loop or parent LLM |
| **Routing/Handoff Error** | Wrong sub-agent selected (multi-agent systems) |
| **Retrieval Failure** | RAG returned irrelevant or missing context — check sibling retrieval spans |
| **Context Overflow** | Critical info lost due to context length |
| **Upstream Data Issue** | A sibling or parent span provided bad data that cascaded to the evaluated span |
| **Runtime Error** | Tool/API failure, timeout, exception — from `find_llmobs_error_spans` |
| **Evaluator Miscalibration** | Eval criteria produce false positives/negatives |

---

### Phase 5: Generate Recommendations

**Goal**: Concrete, actionable recommendations grounded in trace evidence. Not generic advice — actual text/code changes with before/after quotes from the trace.

Recommendation types: **System Prompt Edit** (quote actual prompt, provide before/after), **Tool Gap/Misuse** (reference agent loop steps), **Routing/Handoff Fix**, **Retrieval Fix** (show retrieved vs needed), **Evaluator Prompt Edit** (flag that eval changes need re-validation), **Other**.

**When run in Claude Code with codebase access**: Search the codebase for system prompt, tool definitions, or routing logic. Propose specific diffs. Always ask before modifying files.

### Phase 6: Compile RCA Report

Write the full report following the Output Format below. **This is the primary deliverable — output it directly in the chat.**

---

### Phase 7: Post-Analysis Actions

**Do NOT take any action automatically.** After presenting the report, ask the user what they'd like to do next. Suggest options:

1. Save the report to `eval-rca-{eval_name}-{date}.md`
2. Apply fixes (if codebase is available)
3. Deeper investigation of remaining categories

- **Root cause over symptom**: "System prompt doesn't specify date format" not "model gave wrong answer."
- **Show your math**: "47 failures (34%)" not "many failures."
- **Honest about uncertainty**: < 5 examples = tentative. Flag it.
- **Anonymize PII**: No emails or names. User/org IDs are fine.
