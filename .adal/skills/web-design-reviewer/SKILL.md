# Web Design Reviewer

Use this skill for visual QA and source-level fixes after a page is already running. This is not the right skill for functional automation or regression suites.

## Activation Conditions

- Reviewing a live page for layout or spacing defects
- Checking responsive behavior at a few critical widths
- Comparing a page to a design system or visual target
- Tracing a visible issue back to CSS, Tailwind classes, or component structure

## Recommended Workflow

1. Open the page with a browser-capable MCP client such as Playwright MCP.
2. Capture the current state before editing.
3. Test desktop and mobile widths.
4. Fix the source code, then re-check the same viewports.

## Playwright MCP Mapping

These tool names are current in the Playwright MCP server used by Codex:

- `browser_navigate` to open the page
- `browser_snapshot` to inspect accessible structure
- `browser_take_screenshot` for before and after captures
- `browser_resize` for responsive review
- `browser_console_messages` and `browser_network_requests` to catch front-end breakage

## Review Checklist

- [ ] No overflow or clipped content at target widths
- [ ] Interactive controls remain visible and reachable
- [ ] Text contrast and focus states are acceptable
- [ ] Repeated components use consistent spacing, typography, and color
- [ ] Fixes were verified visually after the code change

- [Framework Fixes](./references/framework-fixes.md) - Typical fix locations for CSS, Tailwind, CSS modules, and component styles

### Scripts
- [CSS Risk Audit](./scripts/css-risk-audit.py) - Scan CSS and front-end source for risky fixed widths, viewport traps, and overflow patterns

## Cross-Client Portability

This skill is written to stay usable across GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI.

- GitHub Copilot: keep the folder in a Copilot-visible skill or plugin path, or wrap the workflow as project instructions if the host does not support portable skill folders directly.
- Claude Code: keep the folder in a local skills directory or a compatible plugin or marketplace source.
- Codex: install or sync the folder into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>` and restart Codex after major changes.
- Gemini CLI: this repository generates a project command named `/skills:web-design-reviewer` from this skill. Rebuild commands with `python scripts/export-gemini-skill.py web-design-reviewer` and then run `/commands reload` inside Gemini CLI.

## MCP Availability And Fallback

Preferred MCP servers for this skill:
- `Playwright MCP` (primary)
- `Chrome DevTools MCP (optional)` (primary)

If MCP is unavailable in the current host:
- Use Playwright CLI, browser devtools, screenshots, and manual responsive checks when MCP browser tools are unavailable.
- Capture console or network issues with the browser or terminal before proposing visual fixes.
