- "Easy to use" in: [REQ-067, REQ-089, REQ-091]
- "Intuitive" in: [REQ-102, REQ-115]

**Recommendation**: Replace with specific, measurable criteria. Examples:
- "User-friendly" → "New users complete first task in < 5 minutes without help"
- "Fast" → "Response time < 2 seconds for 95% of requests"

### 3. Consistency & Conflict Analysis

**Rating**: [Excellent / Good / Fair / Poor] ([score]%)

**Issues Found**:

#### Conflicting Requirements
- 🔴 **Conflict #1**: Requirements [REQ-012] vs [REQ-089]
  - **REQ-012**: "[Full requirement text]"
  - **REQ-089**: "[Conflicting requirement text]"
  - **Conflict Nature**: [Explanation of the conflict]

| ------------------------- | ------------- |---------------------------|
| User / Customer / Client / End-user | 45 / 23 / 12 / 8 | "User" (most common) |
| Login / Sign-in / Log-in / Sign in | 15 / 8 / 7 / 4 | "Login" (matches system) |
| Order / Purchase / Transaction | 34 / 12 / 8 | "Order" (business term) |

**Recommendation**: Create glossary defining standard terms and update all requirements.

#### Priority Conflicts
- [REQ-045] marked Critical but depends on [REQ-078] marked Medium
- Too many requirements (35 of 120) marked as "Critical" priority
- [REQ-089] and [REQ-091] both marked Priority 1 but mutually exclusive

### 4. Testability Assessment

**Rating**: [Excellent / Good / Fair / Poor] ([score]%)

**Issues Found**:

#### Untestable Requirements
- ❌ **[REQ-034]**: "The system shall be secure"
  - **Issue**: No measurable criteria for determining if "secure"
  - **Recommendation**: Break into testable requirements:
    - "System shall enforce password complexity (8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special char)"
    - "System shall lock accounts after 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes"
    - "System shall encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.3"
    - "System shall encrypt sensitive PII at rest using AES-256"
    - "System shall log all authentication attempts with timestamp and IP"

- ❌ **[REQ-067]**: "Application shall be maintainable"
  - **Issue**: Subjective, no objective pass/fail
  - **Recommendation**:
    - "Code shall maintain 80% unit test coverage"
    - "Cyclomatic complexity shall not exceed 10 per function"
    - "All public APIs shall have JSDoc/XML documentation"
    - "No code duplication blocks exceeding 10 lines"

#### Missing Acceptance Criteria
User stories lacking acceptance criteria:
- [US-045]: "As a user, I want to search products..."
- [US-056]: "As a customer, I want to track my order..."
- [US-078]: "As an admin, I want to manage users..."
- [US-089]: "As a user, I want to save favorites..."

**Total**: 23 user stories (of 87) lack acceptance criteria

**Recommendation**: Add Given-When-Then acceptance criteria for all stories before sprint planning.

#### Requirements Without Verification Method
- [REQ-023, REQ-034, REQ-056, REQ-078, REQ-091]: No test approach defined
- No verification method specified for non-functional requirements in Section 4.3

- [REQ-145]: Real-time dashboard feature (Who requested? Why needed?)
- [REQ-167]: Advanced reporting module (Business value unclear)
- [REQ-189]: Mobile app support (Not in original scope?)

**Recommendation**: Link each requirement to:
- Business objective or goal
- Stakeholder who requested it
- Business case element (ROI, cost savings, revenue)

#### Missing Forward Traceability
**Requirements Without Design Coverage**: [45 requirements]
- Section 3.2 (User Management): No architecture/design documented
- Section 3.5 (Reporting): No UI mockups or data model

**Requirements Without Test Cases**: [78 requirements]
- No test cases mapped for functional requirements in Sections 3.1-3.4
- Non-functional requirements (Section 4) have no test strategy

**Untraced Business Needs**:
Business objectives mentioned in charter but not in requirements:
- "Support mobile access for field workers" - No mobile requirements
- "Integrate with payment gateway" - No payment processing requirements
- "Provide analytics dashboard" - Basic reporting only, no analytics

**Recommendation**: Create or update Requirements Traceability Matrix linking:
- Business Need → Requirement → Design → Implementation → Test Case

### 6. Standards Compliance Assessment

**Rating**: [Excellent / Good / Fair / Poor] ([score]%)

**Issues Found**:

#### IEEE 830 Compliance (if applicable)
- ❌ Missing: Glossary of terms (Section 1.4)
- ❌ Missing: Assumptions and dependencies documented
- ⚠️ Incomplete: Version control information (no change history)
- ⚠️ Incomplete: Only 60% of requirements have verification methods

#### Industry Standards (if applicable)
- [List specific standard] requirement [X] not met: [explanation]
- [Standard] compliance requirement missing: [what's needed]

#### Agile Best Practices (if applicable)
- 23 user stories do not follow INVEST criteria (missing testability)
- Definition of Done not documented
- Stories not properly sized (12 stories estimated > 13 points)
- Epic decomposition incomplete for [Epic-005] and [Epic-007]

### 7. Feasibility & Risk Assessment

**Rating**: [Excellent / Good / Fair / Poor] ([score]%)

#### High-Risk Requirements

| Req ID | Requirement Summary | Risk Category | Risk Level | Impact | Mitigation Needed |
| -------- | ------------------- |---------------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| REQ-045 | Real-time sync across 100K concurrent users | Technical complexity, Performance | High | Project timeline, Budget | POC/spike required, architecture review |
| REQ-067 | AI-based product recommendations | Unproven technology, Resource | Medium | Feature delivery | Evaluate ML platforms, skill assessment |
| REQ-089 | Sub-second global search | Performance, Infrastructure | High | User satisfaction | Load testing, CDN strategy |

**Recommendations**:
- **REQ-045**: Conduct proof-of-concept for real-time architecture before committing
- **REQ-067**: Evaluate 3rd-party ML services vs build, assess team ML skills
- **REQ-089**: Performance testing with realistic data volumes, consider search service

#### Feasibility Concerns
- **Technical**: [List technical feasibility concerns]
- **Resource**: [List resource/skill availability concerns]
- **Timeline**: [List schedule risk concerns]
- **Budget**: [List cost concerns]

## Approval Recommendation

### Decision
**[Approve with Conditions / Major Revision Needed / Reject]**

### Rationale
[Provide 2-3 sentences explaining the recommendation based on findings. Example:]

The requirements show a solid foundation with clear business objectives and well-structured functional requirements (65 of 120 requirements have no issues). However, critical gaps exist in security requirements, requirement conflicts need resolution, and 23 user stories lack acceptance criteria needed for development. The testability and traceability scores (65% and 68%) fall significantly below the 90% target, indicating substantial rework is needed before the requirements can serve as a reliable foundation for design and development.

### Conditions for Approval (if "Approve with Conditions")

1. **All critical issues (A-001 through A-003) must be resolved**
   - Security requirements section added and reviewed
   - All requirement conflicts resolved with stakeholder agreement
   - Acceptance criteria added to all user stories

2. **Major issues should be addressed or have mitigation plans**
   - Performance requirements clarified with specific targets
   - Traceability matrix completed and validated
   - Terminology standardized across all requirements

3. **Updated version to be re-reviewed**
   - Submit updated requirements document by [date]
   - Targeted review of previously identified issues
   - Final approval within 3 business days of submission

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: BA team addresses critical issues (A-001 through A-003)
2. **Week 1**: Resolve requirement conflicts with stakeholder meetings
3. **Week 2**: Complete major quality improvements (A-004 through A-006)
4. **Week 3**: Submit updated requirements for targeted re-review
5. **Week 4**: Final approval and handoff to design team
