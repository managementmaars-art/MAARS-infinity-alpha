□ Typically 1-5 days of effort

### Testable

## Common Quality Issues

### Ambiguity Examples

❌ **Bad**: "The system shall be fast"
✅ **Good**: "The system shall respond to user search queries within 2 seconds for 95% of requests under normal load"

❌ **Bad**: "The interface shall be user-friendly"
✅ **Good**: "New users shall be able to complete their first purchase within 5 minutes without requiring help documentation"

❌ **Bad**: "The system shall handle many concurrent users"
✅ **Good**: "The system shall support 10,000 concurrent users with 99.9% uptime and response times under 3 seconds"

### Incompleteness Examples

❌ **Bad**: "The system shall send notifications"
✅ **Good**: "The system shall send email notifications to users within 5 minutes when their order status changes to 'Shipped', including order number, new status, tracking link, and estimated delivery date"

❌ **Bad**: "Users shall be able to search products"
✅ **Good**: "Users shall be able to search products by keyword, category, price range ($-$$$$), and brand, with results displayed in relevance order and pagination (20 items per page) within 2 seconds"

### Untestability Examples

❌ **Bad**: "The system shall be secure"
✅ **Good**: "The system shall: (1) enforce password complexity (min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special char), (2) lock accounts after 5 failed login attempts for 15 minutes, (3) encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.3, (4) encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256"

❌ **Bad**: "The application shall be maintainable"
✅ **Good**: "The application code shall maintain: (1) 80% unit test coverage, (2) cyclomatic complexity below 10 per function, (3) no duplicated code blocks over 10 lines, (4) JSDoc comments for all public APIs"

### Inconsistency Examples

**Conflicting Requirements**
❌ Requirement A: "Users must provide phone number during registration"
   Requirement B: "Phone number is optional during account creation"
   → **Conflict**: Mandatory vs optional field

❌ Requirement A (Priority: High): "System must support real-time data synchronization"
   Requirement B (Priority: High): "System processes data in nightly batch jobs only"
   → **Conflict**: Real-time vs batch processing approach

**Terminology Inconsistencies**
❌ Using "User", "Customer", and "Client" interchangeably
✅ Use one consistent term throughout, defined in glossary

❌ Using "Order", "Purchase", and "Transaction" to mean the same thing
✅ Define precise meanings or use one term consistently

### Over-Specification Examples

❌ **Bad**: "The primary action button shall be colored #0066CC with 12px Arial font, 5px padding, 2px border radius, and box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"
✅ **Good**: "Primary action buttons shall follow the design system style guide for primary CTAs"

❌ **Bad**: "Error messages shall be displayed in 14pt Helvetica Neue font, colored #D32F2F, with icon error_outline from Material Design icons"
✅ **Good**: "Error messages shall follow the design system error message pattern for visibility and accessibility"

## Acceptance Criteria Formats

### Given-When-Then (Behavior-Driven)

```gherkin
Given: User is logged in with a valid account
  And: User has items in shopping cart
When: User clicks "Place Order" button
Then: Order is created with unique order ID
  And: User receives confirmation email within 5 minutes
  And: Order appears in user's order history within 2 seconds
  And: Inventory is decremented immediately
  And: Payment is processed successfully
```

### Checklist Format

```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria for User Login**

□ User can enter email and password
□ System validates email format before submission
□ System displays error for invalid credentials
□ Successful login redirects to user dashboard
□ Session persists for 30 days with "Remember me"
□ Failed login shows clear error message
□ Account locks after 5 failed attempts
□ Password field masks characters
□ Forgot password link is visible and functional
```

### Scenario-Based Format

```markdown
**Scenario 1: Successful Product Search**
- User enters "laptop" in search box
- System returns results within 2 seconds
- Results show 10-50 relevant products
- Each result displays: image, name, price, rating
- User can filter by price range and brand

**Scenario 2: No Results Found**
- User enters "xyzabc12345" (non-existent)
- System displays "No results found" message
- System suggests: (1) Check spelling, (2) Try different keywords, (3) Browse categories
- Search took less than 2 seconds

**Scenario 3: Partial Match**
- User enters "lapto" (typo)
- System suggests "Did you mean: laptop?"
- Clicking suggestion performs correct search
- Alternative results still shown for "lapto"
```

## Quality Scoring Guidelines

### Scoring Scale (0-100%)

**90-100% (Excellent)**

- All criteria met or exceeded
- No critical or major issues
- Minor issues only (cosmetic, formatting)
- Requirements are production-ready

**70-89% (Good)**

- Most criteria met
- No critical issues
- Few major issues with clear resolution path
- Requirements ready with minor revisions

**50-69% (Fair)**

- Some criteria met
- Few critical issues OR multiple major issues
- Significant revision needed
- Requirements need substantial work

**0-49% (Poor)**

- Many criteria not met
- Multiple critical issues
- Major rework required
- Requirements not ready for next phase

### Issue Severity Definitions

**Critical (Must Fix)**

- Blocks project progress
- Causes major business impact
- Prevents requirement from being implemented
- Creates legal/compliance risk
- Examples: Missing security requirements, fundamental conflicts, incomplete scope

**Major (Should Fix)**

- Significantly impacts quality or implementation
- Causes confusion or ambiguity
- Increases risk of rework
- Affects multiple stakeholders
- Examples: Ambiguous performance criteria, missing acceptance criteria, terminology inconsistencies

**Minor (Nice to Fix)**

- Does not block progress
- Has workarounds available
- Cosmetic or formatting issues
- Minimal impact on implementation
- Examples: Formatting inconsistencies, minor typos, missing diagrams (if content is clear)

## Traceability Assessment

### Backward Traceability

Each requirement should trace to:
□ Business objective or strategic goal
□ Stakeholder need (who requested and why)
□ Business case element (ROI, benefit)
□ Market requirement or competitive analysis
□ Regulatory/compliance mandate (if applicable)
□ User research finding or usability study

### Forward Traceability

Each requirement should trace to:
□ Design elements (architecture diagrams, UI mockups)
□ Architecture components (services, modules, APIs)
□ Implementation tasks or user stories
□ Test cases (unit, integration, acceptance)
□ Validation criteria and acceptance tests
□ Documentation and help content (if user-facing)

### Traceability Matrix Quality

□ Complete coverage - no orphan requirements
□ Unique, consistent identifiers for all items
□ Clear, documented relationships between items
□ Version tracking for requirement changes
□ Impact analysis capability (what breaks if requirement changes)
□ Maintained throughout project lifecycle

### Gap Analysis

Identify and document:

- **Missing Requirements**: Business needs without corresponding requirements
- **Orphan Requirements**: Requirements without business justification
- **Untested Requirements**: Requirements without mapped test cases
- **Undesigned Requirements**: Requirements without design coverage
- **Unstakeholdered Needs**: Potential stakeholder needs not yet captured
