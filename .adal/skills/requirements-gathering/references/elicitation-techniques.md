```markdown
# Semi-Structured Interview Approach

## Preparation
- Prepare key themes/topics
- Have core questions ready
- Allow room for exploration
- Be ready to follow interesting threads

## Flexible Question Flow

Start with open questions:
- "Tell me about your experience with..."
- "How do you typically..."
- "What challenges do you face when..."

Follow up with probing:
- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "Why is that important?"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "What would happen if..."

Adapt based on responses:
- Follow unexpected insights
- Dig deeper into pain points
- Explore mentioned workarounds
- Ask about edge cases

## Active Listening Techniques
- Pause before responding
- Summarize what you heard
- Ask clarifying questions
- Watch for non-verbal cues
- Note emotional responses
```

**Five Whys Technique**:

```markdown
# Example: Understanding Root Cause

Problem: Sales team wants a faster quote system

Interview dialogue:
Q: "Why do you need a faster quote system?"
A: "Because customers are waiting too long for quotes"

Q: "Why are customers waiting too long?"
A: "Because it takes 2-3 days to generate a quote"

Q: "Why does it take 2-3 days?"
A: "Because we have to manually look up prices in multiple systems"

Q: "Why do you have to manually look up prices?"
A: "Because our CRM doesn't integrate with the pricing system"

Q: "Why doesn't the CRM integrate with pricing?"
A: "Because they're on different platforms with no API connection"

Root Cause Identified: Lack of system integration
Real Requirement: API integration between CRM and pricing system
```

### Unstructured Interviews

**Purpose**: Explore unknown territory, build relationships

**Best For**:

- Initial discovery
- Understanding culture
- Building stakeholder relationships
- Innovative solutions

**Approach**:

```markdown
# Unstructured Interview Guidelines

Start with broad, open questions:
- "Tell me about your work"
- "What's on your mind these days?"
- "What keeps you up at night?"

Let conversation flow naturally:
- Follow the stakeholder's lead
- Don't force your agenda
- Listen more than talk (80/20 rule)
- Observe their environment
- Note what they emphasize

Look for:
- Repeated themes
- Emotional reactions
- Workarounds they've created
- Wish lists and frustrations
- Contradictions
```

## Workshop Techniques

### Requirements Workshop

**Purpose**: Collaborative requirements definition with multiple stakeholders

**Setup**:

```markdown
# Workshop Planning Checklist

□ Define clear objectives
□ Identify right participants (6-12 people)
□ Book appropriate space (in-person or virtual)
□ Schedule 2-4 hours
□ Prepare materials and tools
□ Send pre-read materials 2 days before
□ Arrange for refreshments (if in-person)

Participants Should Include:
- Business stakeholders (decision-makers)
- End users (actual system users)
- Technical representatives
- Business analyst (facilitator)
- Subject matter experts
- QA representative
```

**Facilitation Techniques**:

**1. Round Robin**

```markdown
Purpose: Ensure all voices are heard

Process:
1. Pose a question
2. Go around the room
3. Each person shares one idea
4. No discussion yet
5. Repeat until ideas exhausted
6. Then discuss as group

Good for:
- Brainstorming features
- Identifying risks
- Gathering concerns
```

**2. Silent Brainstorming**

```markdown
Purpose: Generate many ideas quickly

Process:
1. Present the prompt/question
2. Everyone writes ideas on sticky notes (5-10 minutes)
3. Post all sticky notes on wall
4. Group similar ideas
5. Discuss and prioritize

Benefits:
- Introverts can contribute
- No groupthink
- Many ideas quickly
- Democratic participation
```

**3. Affinity Diagramming**

```markdown
Purpose: Organize large amounts of information

Process:
1. Collect all ideas (sticky notes)
2. Silently group related items
3. Name each group
4. Discuss groupings
5. Create hierarchy if needed

Example:
User Management
├── Registration
├── Login
├── Profile
└── Permissions

Product Catalog
├── Browse
├── Search
├── Details
└── Compare
```

**4. Dot Voting**

```markdown
Purpose: Prioritize democratically

Process:
1. List all options on wall
2. Give each person 3-5 votes (dots)
3. People place dots on their priorities
4. Can put multiple dots on one item
5. Tally votes
6. Discuss results

Variations:
- Use different colored dots (Must Have, Should Have)
- Give stakeholders more votes
- Do multiple rounds
```

### Contextual Inquiry

**Purpose**: Observe and interview simultaneously

**Four Principles**:

**1. Context**: Work in user's actual environment

```markdown
- Go to their workspace
- Use their equipment
- Experience their interruptions
- Understand their constraints
```

**2. Partnership**: User as expert, analyst as apprentice

```markdown
- Let user lead
- Ask questions as apprentice
- "Teach me how you do this"
- Validate understanding
```

**3. Interpretation**: Develop shared understanding

```markdown
- Discuss observations together
- "It seems like you do X because Y, is that right?"
- Confirm or correct interpretations
- Build shared mental model
```

**4. Focus**: Keep inquiry goal-directed

```markdown
- Stay aligned with project goals
- Explore relevant areas deeply
- Politely redirect tangents
- Balance breadth and depth
```

**Example Session**:

```markdown
# Contextual Inquiry Session

User: Customer Service Representative
Location: Call center
Duration: 2 hours

Approach:
1. Observe rep handling calls
2. Ask questions between calls
3. Have rep explain their thinking
4. Validate interpretations

Sample Dialogue:
BA: "I noticed you had three screens open. Can you show me what each one is for?"
Rep: "This one is the CRM, this is the order system, and this is the knowledge base."

BA: "Why do you need three different systems?"
Rep: "The CRM doesn't have order info, and the order system doesn't have customer history."

BA: "How does that impact your work?"
Rep: "I have to switch between screens constantly. Sometimes I give customers wrong info because I'm looking at the wrong screen."

BA: "It sounds like having all information in one place would help. Is that right?"
Rep: "Yes! That would save me so much time and reduce errors."

Requirement Identified: Unified customer view with order history
```
