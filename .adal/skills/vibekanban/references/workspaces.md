# Workspaces (Beta)

New UI mode for multi-repo development, sessions, and improved workflow.

## Overview

Workspaces provide a modern interface for working with AI coding agents:

- **Multi-repo support**: Work across multiple repositories in one workspace
- **Sessions**: Multiple conversation threads per workspace
- **Command Bar**: Keyboard-driven navigation (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`)
- **Workspace Notes**: Document requirements and decisions
- **Integrated Terminal**: PTY-backed terminal with xterm.js

## Creating Workspaces

1. Click `+` in sidebar or use `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → **New Workspace**
2. Select project from dropdown (or create new)
3. Add repositories:
   - Recent repos list
   - Browse disk
   - Create new repo
4. Set target branches for each repo
5. Describe task in chat input
6. Select agent
7. Click **Create**

Workspace auto-creates working branch from target branch.

**Defaults**: Create flow now defaults to the last used project/repo/branch and sets a base target branch automatically. Adjust per repo if needed.

Draft workspace-creation preference is also persisted, which is useful if you regularly stage workspaces before fully launching them.

## Workspace Create Flow Updates (v0.1.15)

- Navigation in create flow is standardized via callback handlers.
- Preferred repo/branch selections are preserved more consistently.
- Workspace creation respects `executor_config` with safer fallback defaults.

## Create Workspace from PR

Use the **Create Workspace from PR** action to prefill repo and branch context from an existing pull request.

## Remote Routes

Workspaces support remote routes for deep-linking into a specific workspace context.

## Remote Access (v0.1.21)

Remote Access lets you connect to a **host machine running Vibe Kanban** from another device and access that host's workspaces.

### Pair a Host

Host (the machine running Vibe Kanban):

1. Start Vibe Kanban and sign in.
2. Open Settings → **Remote Access**.
3. Generate / copy the pairing code.

Client (the device you want to control from):

1. Sign in at https://cloud.vibekanban.com
2. Open **Remote Access** → link/add a host.
3. Paste the pairing code.

After pairing, the client can list and open the host's workspaces.

### Security Notes (High Level)

- Pairing is code-based and intended to be explicit (you choose which host to link).
- The model is designed to be “zero trust” style: requests/actions are signed on the client and verified on the host.

## Sessions

Conversation threads within a workspace. All sessions share repos and git state.

### When to Create New Sessions

- Work on different parts simultaneously
- Try alternative approaches
- Work around token limits
- Use different agents for different tasks

### Session States

| State           | Meaning                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Running         | Agent actively processing                  |
| Idle            | Waiting for input                          |
| Needs Attention | Agent waiting for approval or has question |

### Creating Sessions

1. Click session dropdown in chat toolbar
2. Select **+ New Session**
3. Provide context about existing work if needed

Sessions maintain independent conversation history.

Session dropdown shows agent icons next to session titles for quick identification.

### Session Naming (v0.1.31)

- Sessions can be renamed explicitly.
- Vibe Kanban can also auto-name purpose-specific sessions to keep multi-session workspaces easier to scan.

## Command Bar

Central hub for navigation and actions. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K`.

## Slash Commands

Type `/` in the chat input to open the slash command menu for quick actions.

### Quick Actions

| Command           | Description               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| New Workspace     | Create new workspace      |
| Open in IDE       | Open in configured editor |
| Copy Path         | Copy workspace path       |
| Toggle Dev Server | Start/stop dev server     |
| Open in Old UI    | Switch to classic kanban  |
| Settings          | Open application settings |

### Workspace Actions

| Command             | Description            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Start Review        | Begin code review      |
| Rename Workspace    | Change name            |
| Duplicate Workspace | Create copy            |
| Pin/Unpin           | Toggle pinned status   |
| Archive/Unarchive   | Move to/from archive   |

## Workspace Action Reliability (v0.1.28)

- **Spin Off Workspace** preserves the working branch more reliably.
- **Duplicate Workspace** preserves executor configuration instead of falling back unexpectedly.
- Linked issue handling in workspace actions is more reliable, so copied or spun-off workspaces keep better issue continuity.

## Workspace Logs Capture (v0.1.23)

Workspace logs capture was updated in v0.1.23 (root execution-process provider). If logs look missing or truncated, upgrading to 0.1.23+ is the first thing to try.

### Git Actions

| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Create Pull Request  | Open PR dialog      |
| Merge                | Merge to target     |
| Rebase               | Rebase onto target  |
| Change Target Branch | Switch merge target |
| Push                 | Push to remote      |

## Interface Guide

### Layout Panels

| Panel         | Position | Content                |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Left Sidebar  | Left     | Workspace list, search |
| Chat Panel    | Center   | Agent conversation     |
| Right Sidebar | Right    | Git info, Notes, Logs  |
| Changes Panel | Bottom   | Code diffs             |
| Preview       | Bottom   | Dev server preview     |
| Logs          | Bottom   | Process/terminal logs  |

### Workspace List

- Shows active workspace count
- Uses infinite scroll pagination for large lists

### Sidebar Filters & Sorting (v0.1.7)

- Filter by **Project** and **PR status** from the workspace sidebar
- Use **No project** to show unassigned workspaces
- Sorting in the accordion sidebar prioritizes older completed workspaces
- **Needs Attention** includes workspaces with unseen activity

### Branch Search

Search workspaces by branch name in sidebar.

### Drag-and-Drop Images

Drag images directly into chat for context.

As of v0.1.28, image attachments can also be sent during an active agent run, which makes iterative UI and screenshot-driven workflows smoother.

As of v0.1.32, attachments are no longer limited to images; arbitrary attachments can be carried across workspace and issue flows.

## Integrated Terminal

PTY-backed terminal with full shell support:

- Expandable in logs panel
- Shell init scripts supported
- WebSocket reconnection for stability

## Multi-Repo Workspaces

Work across multiple repositories:

- Each repo has independent git state
- Per-repo commands in Command Bar
- Commits behind indicator in git panel

### Per-Repo Actions

| Command             | Description             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Copy Repo Path      | Copy specific repo path |
| Open Repo in IDE    | Open just this repo     |
| Repository Settings | Configure repo options  |
| Create PR (repo)    | PR for specific repo    |
| Merge/Rebase (repo) | Operations per repo     |

## Duplicating Workspaces

Use `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → Workspace Actions → **Duplicate Workspace**

Duplicates repos and branch config with fresh conversation.

## Spin Off Workspace

Use **Spin Off Workspace** to create a child workspace from the current one.

In v0.1.15, spin-off preserves linked issue context and preferred repository/branch metadata more reliably.

In v0.1.28, spin-off also preserves the branch more reliably during workspace actions.

## Archiving

Archive completed workspaces:

- Navbar: Click **Archive** button
- Command Bar: Workspace Actions → Archive

View archive at bottom of sidebar. Use **Pin** for important active workspaces.

## Simple IDs

Issues have readable IDs like `BLO-5` for easy reference.
