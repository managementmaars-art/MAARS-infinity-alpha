# Getting Started

## Setup

1. **Install the agentcash CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g agentcash
   ```

2. **Check wallet:**

   ```

3. **Fund wallet** (if needed):
   - Redeem invite: `npx agentcash@latest redeem YOUR_CODE`
   - Or run `npx agentcash@latest accounts` to get Base or Solana deposit links and wallet addresses

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Command not found" | Run `npm install -g agentcash` |
| "Insufficient balance" | Fund wallet with USDC |
| "Payment failed" | Check balance, retry (transient errors) |
| "No match found" | Try different identifiers (email vs LinkedIn) or use search first |
| "405 Method Not Allowed" | Verify endpoint path matches exactly from Quick Reference table in SKILL.md |
