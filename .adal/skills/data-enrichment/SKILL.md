# Data Enrichment with x402 APIs

Use the agentcash CLI to access enrichment APIs at stableenrich.dev.

## Setup

See [rules/getting-started.md](rules/getting-started.md) for installation and wallet setup.


## Notes

ALWAYS use `npx agentcash@latest fetch` for stableenrich.dev endpoints - never curl or WebFetch.
Returns structured JSON data, not web page HTML.

IMPORTANT: Use exact endpoint paths from the Quick Reference table below. All paths include a provider prefix (`https://stableenrich.dev/api/apollo/...`, `https://stableenrich.dev/api/clado/...`, etc.).

## Workflows

### Standard Enrichment

- [ ] (Optional) Check balance: `npx agentcash@latest balance`
- [ ] Use `npx agentcash@latest discover https://stableenrich.dev` to list all endpoints
- [ ] Use `npx agentcash@latest check <endpoint-url>` to see expected parameters and pricing
- [ ] Call endpoint with `npx agentcash@latest fetch`
- [ ] Parse and present results

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/apollo/people-enrich -m POST -b '{"email": "user@company.com"}'
```

## Person Enrichment

Enrich a person using any available identifier:

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/apollo/people-enrich -m POST -b '{
  "email": "john@company.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "organization_name": "Acme Inc",
  "domain": "company.com",
  "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
}'
```

**Input options** (provide any combination):
- `email` - Email address (most reliable)
- `linkedin_url` - LinkedIn profile URL
- `first_name` + `last_name` - Name (works better with domain/org)
- `organization_name` or `domain` - Helps match the right person

**Returns**: Name, title, company, employment history, location, social profiles, phone numbers.

## Company Enrichment

Enrich a company by domain:

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/apollo/org-enrich -m POST -b '{"domain": "stripe.com"}'
```

**Returns**: Company name, industry, employee count, revenue estimates, funding info, technologies used, social links.

## People Search

Search for people matching criteria:

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/apollo/people-search -m POST -b '{
  "q_keywords": "software engineer",
  "person_titles": ["CTO", "VP Engineering"],
  "organization_domains": ["google.com", "meta.com"],
  "person_locations": ["San Francisco, CA"]
}'
```

**Search filters**:
- `q_keywords` - Keywords to search
- `person_titles` - Job title filters
- `organization_domains` - Company domains
- `person_locations` - Location filters
- `person_seniorities` - Seniority levels

## Company Search

Search for companies matching criteria:

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/apollo/org-search -m POST -b '{
  "q_keywords": "fintech",
  "organization_locations": ["New York, NY"],
  "organization_num_employees_ranges": ["51-200", "201-500"]
}'
```

## Contact Recovery (Clado)

Enrich contact info from LinkedIn URL, email, or phone. Provide exactly one of `linkedin_url`, `email`, or `phone`:

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/clado/contacts-enrich -m POST -b '{
  "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
}'
```

**Returns**: Validated email addresses and phone numbers with confidence scores.

**Note:** For LinkedIn profile data (experience, education, skills), use Minerva `/api/minerva/enrich` instead of Clado.

## Minerva Identity Resolution

Resolve a person to a unique Minerva PID and LinkedIn URL:

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/minerva/resolve -m POST -b '{
  "records": [
    {
      "record_id": "user_001",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Smith",
      "emails": ["john@company.com"]
    }
  ]
}'
```

**Parameters:**
- `records` array with: `record_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `emails`, `phones`, `linkedin_url`
- Supports fuzzy match (name + contact) and reverse lookup (email/phone only, no name needed)
- Use `match_condition_fields: ["linkedin_url"]` to only return matches with LinkedIn

## Minerva Enrichment

Enrich with demographics, work history, education, contact info, addresses, financial signals:

Three lookup modes: by Minerva PID (fastest), by LinkedIn URL, or by name/email/phone.

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/minerva/enrich -m POST -b '{
  "records": [
    {
      "record_id": "user_001",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Smith",
      "emails": ["john@company.com"]
    }
  ],
  "return_fields": ["full_name", "personal_emails", "phones", "work_experience"]
}'
```

**Parameters:**
- `records` array with: `record_id` + one of `minerva_pid`, `linkedin_url`, or name/email/phone
- `return_fields` array to limit response (e.g., `["full_name", "personal_emails", "phones", "work_experience"]`)
- `match_condition_fields` to filter matches (e.g., `["email", "phone"]`)

## Minerva Email Validation

Check if emails exist in the Minerva database:

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/minerva/validate-emails -m POST -b '{
  "records": ["john@company.com", "jane@example.com"]
}'
```

**Returns**: Validation status and last-seen timestamps. Use before resolve/enrich to pre-screen lists.

## Cost Optimization

### Field Filtering

Reduce costs by excluding unneeded fields:

```json
{
  "email": "john@company.com",
  "excludeFields": ["employment_history", "photos", "phone_numbers"]
}
```

Common fields to exclude:
- `employment_history` - Past jobs (often large)
- `photos` - Profile images
- `phone_numbers` - If you only need email
- `social_profiles` - If you don't need social links

### Search Before Enrich

Use search endpoints ($0.02) to find the right records before enriching ($0.0495):

1. Search for candidates: `https://stableenrich.dev/api/apollo/people-search`
2. Review results, pick the right match
3. Enrich only the matches you need

## Email Verification (Hunter)

Verify if an email address is deliverable before sending outreach:

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/hunter/email-verifier -m POST -b '{"email": "john@stripe.com"}'
```

**Returns**: Deliverability status, MX record validation, SMTP verification, confidence score, and flags for catch-all, disposable, or role-based addresses.

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `deliverable` | Email exists and accepts mail | Safe to send |
| `undeliverable` | Email doesn't exist or rejects mail | Do not send |
| `risky` | Catch-all domain or temporary issues | Send with caution |
| `unknown` | Could not determine status | Try again later |

**Tip:** Combine with people-enrich to find and verify contacts in one pipeline:
1. Search: `people-search` ($0.02) -> find candidates
2. Enrich: `people-enrich` ($0.0495) -> get email
3. Verify: `hunter/email-verifier` ($0.03) -> confirm deliverability

## Influencer Enrichment

Enrich social media influencer/creator profiles across Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Facebook.

### Find Profiles by Email

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/influencer/enrich-by-email -m POST -b '{
  "email": "creator@example.com",
  "platform": "instagram",
  "enrichment_mode": "enhanced"
}'
```

**Parameters:**
- `email` — the creator's email address (required)
- `platform` — `"instagram"`, `"tiktok"`, `"youtube"`, `"twitter"`, `"facebook"` (required)
- `enrichment_mode` — `"enhanced"` for full data (recommended)

**Returns**: Social media profiles, follower counts, engagement metrics, audience demographics, contact info, content categories.

### Enrich by Social Handle

```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/influencer/enrich-by-social -m POST -b '{
  "platform": "instagram",
  "username": "creator_handle",
  "enrichment_mode": "enhanced",
  "email_required": "must_have"
}'
```

**Parameters:**
- `platform` — `"instagram"`, `"tiktok"`, `"youtube"`, `"twitter"`, `"facebook"` (required)
- `username` — handle on that platform (required)
- `enrichment_mode` — `"enhanced"` for full data (recommended)
- `email_required` — `"must_have"` to only return profiles with email

**Returns**: Full profile with engagement metrics, contact info (email, phone), audience demographics, brand affinity, cross-platform links.

### When to Use Which Provider

- **Apollo/Clado** — B2B professional data (job titles, company, employment history)
- **Minerva** — Consumer profiles (demographics, income/wealth estimates, address history, life events, personal contact info)
- **Influencer** — Social media creators (followers, engagement, audience data)

## Handling missing data

If any query fails to return the data you are looking for, revisit the list of available APIs.

Oftentimes, if Apollo is missing data, Clado or Minerva will have it, and vice versa. For consumer profiles (demographics, addresses, financial signals), try Minerva. For social media creators, try the influencer endpoints. For email deliverability, use Hunter.

If those still fail, use built-in WebSearch and WebFetch tools to find additional information like a company domain name or LinkedIn URL, and then use that data to make more targeted queries.
