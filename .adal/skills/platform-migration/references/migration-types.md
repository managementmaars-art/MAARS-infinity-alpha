# Migration Types

## 1. Cloud-to-Cloud Migration

**Common Scenarios:**

- AWS → GCP
- AWS → Azure
- GCP → AWS
- Azure → GCP
- On-Premise → Any Cloud
- Single Cloud → Multi-Cloud

**Key Considerations:**

```markdown

- S3 → Cloud Storage
- RDS → Cloud SQL
- Lambda → Cloud Functions
- ECS/EKS → GKE
- CloudWatch → Cloud Monitoring
- IAM → Cloud IAM

AWS → Azure:
- EC2 → Virtual Machines
- S3 → Blob Storage
- RDS → Azure SQL Database
- Lambda → Azure Functions
- ECS/EKS → AKS
- CloudWatch → Azure Monitor
- IAM → Azure AD
- Route53 → Azure DNS

GCP → AWS:
- Compute Engine → EC2
- Cloud Storage → S3
- Cloud SQL → RDS
- Cloud Functions → Lambda
- GKE → EKS
- Cloud Monitoring → CloudWatch
- Cloud IAM → IAM
- Cloud DNS → Route53
```

**Migration Workflow:**

```markdown
Phase 1: Assessment (Weeks 1-2)
- Inventory all resources in source cloud
- Document dependencies and integrations
- Identify proprietary services (no equivalent)
- Estimate costs in target cloud
- Create service mapping document

Phase 2: Design (Weeks 3-4)
- Design target architecture
- Choose equivalent services
- Plan network topology
- Design IAM/security model
- Document migration approach

Phase 3: Foundation (Weeks 5-6)
- Set up target cloud accounts
- Configure networking (VPC, subnets)
- Establish connectivity (VPN, peering)
- Set up IAM and security groups
- Deploy monitoring infrastructure

Phase 4: Pilot Migration (Weeks 7-8)
- Migrate non-critical workload
- Test functionality
- Validate performance
- Measure costs
- Document lessons learned

Phase 5: Bulk Migration (Weeks 9-16)
- Migrate workloads in waves
- Data replication and sync
- DNS cutover per service
- Validate each migration
- Monitor performance

Phase 6: Optimization (Weeks 17-20)
- Right-size resources
- Optimize costs
- Improve performance
- Decommission source resources
```

### 2. Kubernetes Platform Migration

**Migration Scenarios:**

```markdown
Self-Managed → Managed:
- Self-hosted K8s → EKS/GKE/AKS
- Reason: Reduce operational overhead

Managed → Different Managed:
- EKS → GKE
- AKS → EKS
- Reason: Better features, cost, integration

Managed → Self-Managed:
- EKS → Self-hosted
- Reason: More control, cost optimization

Version Upgrade:
- K8s 1.24 → 1.28
- Reason: Security, features, support
```

**Kubernetes Migration Strategy:**

```markdown
Approach 1: Blue-Green Deployment

1. Provision New Cluster:
   - Create target cluster (same version first)
   - Configure networking
   - Set up ingress controllers
   - Install cluster add-ons

2. Deploy Applications:
   - Deploy all applications to new cluster
   - Configure services and ingress
   - Test functionality thoroughly
   - Run load tests

3. Data Migration:
   - Sync stateful data (PV migration)
   - Replicate databases
   - Validate data integrity

4. Traffic Switch:
   - Update DNS to point to new cluster
   - Monitor application health
   - Keep old cluster running temporarily
   - Decommission old cluster after validation

Approach 2: Gradual Migration

1. Set Up Multi-Cluster Mesh:
   - Install service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)
   - Connect both clusters
   - Enable cross-cluster communication

2. Migrate Services Incrementally:
   - Move one service at a time
   - Route traffic across clusters
   - Validate each service
   - Update dependencies

3. Complete Migration:
   - Migrate all services
   - Remove mesh if not needed
   - Decommission old cluster
```
