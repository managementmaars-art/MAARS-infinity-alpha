    ## AI Tutor Implementation
    
    ### AI Tutor Capabilities
    | Capability | Use Case |
    |------------|----------|
    | Q&A | Answer student questions 24/7 |
    | Explanation | Re-explain concepts differently |
    | Practice | Generate practice problems |
    | Feedback | Review and critique work |
    | Encouragement | Motivate stuck students |
    
    ### Implementation Stack
    | Component | Options |
    |-----------|---------|
    | LLM | GPT-4, Claude, open source |
    | Context | Course content as RAG |
    | Interface | Chat widget, dedicated page |
    | Guardrails | Stay on topic, escalate to human |
    
    ### Prompt Engineering for Tutors
    ```
    You are a tutor for [Course Name].
    
    Your knowledge is limited to:
    [Course content/syllabus]
    
    Rules:
    - Never give direct answers to assessments
    - Use Socratic method (guide, don't tell)
    - If unsure, say "Let me connect you with the instructor"
    - Be encouraging but honest
    ```
    
    ### Hybrid Model
    | Question Type | Handle With |
    |---------------|-------------|
    | Concept clarification | AI |
    | Technical how-to | AI |
    | Personal situation | Human |
    | Complaints/feedback | Human |
    | Advanced questions | Human |

Personalized Learning Paths
  #### **Description**
AI-driven adaptive learning
  #### **When To Use**
When creating personalized experiences
  #### **Implementation**
    ## Personalized Learning Paths
    
    ### Personalization Levels
    | Level | What Adapts | Complexity |
    |-------|-------------|------------|
    | Basic | Content recommendations | Low |
    | Medium | Path through modules | Medium |
    | Advanced | Difficulty + pace + format | High |
    
    ### Basic Implementation
    1. Pre-assessment quiz
    2. AI determines starting point
    3. Skip known content
    4. Focus on gaps
    
    ### Adaptive Path Logic
    ```
    IF score < 70% on module quiz:
      → Review + alternative explanation
      → Practice problems
      → Re-assess
    IF score > 90%:
      → Skip to advanced content
      → Offer bonus challenges
    ```
    
    ### Data Points for Personalization
    - Quiz scores
    - Time spent per lesson
    - Questions asked
    - Completion patterns
    - Self-reported preferences
    
    ### Practical Personalization
    | Input | Adaptation |
    |-------|------------|
    | Failed quiz | Extra practice |
    | Fast completion | Accelerated path |
    | Repeated wrong answer | Different explanation |
    | Long time on topic | Simplified version |

AI Content Generation
  #### **Description**
Using AI to create course content
  #### **When To Use**
When developing course materials with AI
  #### **Implementation**
    ## AI Content Generation
    
    ### What AI Can Generate
    | Content Type | AI Quality | Human Role |
    |--------------|------------|------------|
    | Quiz questions | Good | Review, refine |
    | Practice problems | Good | Verify accuracy |
    | Summaries | Good | Add personality |
    | Explanations | Medium | Verify, contextualize |
    | Video scripts | Medium | Rewrite in your voice |
    | Full lessons | Low | Major editing needed |
    
    ### AI-Assisted Workflow
    1. Human: Outline and key points
    2. AI: Generate first draft
    3. Human: Edit for accuracy and voice
    4. AI: Generate variations
    5. Human: Select and refine
    
    ### Quiz Generation Prompt
    ```
    Create 5 multiple-choice questions about [topic].
    
    Format:
    - 1 correct answer
    - 3 plausible wrong answers
    - Brief explanation for correct answer
    
    Difficulty: [intermediate]
    Test: [application, not recall]
    ```
    
    ### Content Repurposing with AI
    | Source | Generate |
    |--------|----------|
    | Video transcript | Blog post, summary |
    | Blog post | Social posts, quiz |
    | Lesson | Practice problems |
