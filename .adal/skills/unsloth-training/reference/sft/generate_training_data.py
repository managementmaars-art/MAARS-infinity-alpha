Synthetic Training Data Generator for Sales Call Extraction Model
==================================================================

This script generates training data for fine-tuning a sales call extraction model.

Usage:
    1. Add your seed examples to SEED_EXAMPLES below (or load from file)
    2. Set your API key (Claude recommended, GPT-4 works too)
    3. Run: python generate_training_data.py
    4. Output: training_data.jsonl ready for Unsloth

Data generation strategy:
    - Start with 25-50 real examples from your CRM (anonymized)
    - Use LLM to generate 10-20 variations per seed
    - Add template-based generation for edge cases
    - Filter for quality
    - Target: 500-2000 examples

Cost estimate:
    - 50 seeds × 10 variations × ~1000 tokens = ~500K tokens
    - Claude Sonnet: ~$1.50
    - GPT-4o-mini: ~$0.30

VARIATION_PROMPT = """You are generating training data for a sales call extraction model used by MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) contractor software salespeople.

Here's a real example of a sales rep's voice note transcription after a prospect call:

<seed_transcript>
{seed_transcript}
</seed_transcript>

And here's what should be extracted from it:

<seed_extraction>
{seed_extraction}
</seed_extraction>

Generate {num_variations} NEW and DIFFERENT realistic variations. Each should:

1. SOUND LIKE NATURAL SPEECH - These are voice notes recorded in a car after a call:
   - Use filler words occasionally ("um", "so", "like", "you know")
   - Incomplete sentences are fine
   - Stream of consciousness is realistic
   - Mix of formal and casual language

2. COVER MEP CONTRACTOR DIVERSITY:
   - Company sizes from 5 to 200 employees
   - Different specialties: HVAC, plumbing, electrical, fire protection, refrigeration, etc.
   - Different markets: residential, commercial, light commercial, service, new construction
   - Different regions across the US

3. VARY THE INFORMATION DENSITY:
   - Some calls reveal a lot, some reveal little
   - Sometimes names are unclear or missing
   - Sometimes company size is vague ("small shop", "pretty big operation")
   - Not every call has clear next steps

4. INCLUDE REALISTIC SOFTWARE MENTIONS:
   - ServiceTitan, Jobber, FieldEdge, Housecall Pro, Service Fusion
   - QuickBooks, Sage, spreadsheets, paper systems
   - Sometimes they mention competitors or alternatives they've looked at

5. VARY INTENT LEVELS:
   - High intent: urgent pain, budget ready, clear timeline
   - Medium intent: interested but not urgent
   - Low intent: just looking, no timeline, early research
   - Include some calls that go nowhere

6. INCLUDE MEMORABLE QUOTES when appropriate - things the prospect actually said that reveal their situation

For each variation, output in this exact format:

---VARIATION {n}---
