  Maintains persistent codebase knowledge across sessions through a structured knowledge graph

  meaningful code changes (new features, modified components, refactoring, bug fixes) to update
  the project's documentation. Also use it when the user asks to document code, update docs,
  sync documentation, initialize documentation for an existing project, or when you want to
  understand the existing codebase structure at the start of a session. This skill should be
  used proactively after any significant code modification — don't wait for the user to ask.
  If you changed code, update the docs. Think of it as your long-term memory system: read
  before working, write after changing. Also use this when a user says "doctrack init",
  "doctrack refresh", "refresh docs", "update docs", "sync docs", "initialize docs",
  "document this project", or wants to bootstrap documentation for a codebase that has
  no .doctrack/ vault yet.

# Doctrack — Codebase Knowledge Graph

You maintain a **knowledge graph** of project documentation in a local Obsidian vault (`.doctrack/`). The vault travels with the code in git — it's the project's persistent memory across sessions and team members.

**This skill depends on the obsidian skill** (`bitbonsai/mcpvault`) for all vault operations. The obsidian skill handles MCP tool usage, Obsidian CLI, and git sync. Doctrack focuses on **what** knowledge to capture and **how** to structure it — not the mechanics of reading/writing notes.

If the obsidian skill or MCP tools are not available, doctrack init will set them up automatically (see Pre-init).

## Knowledge graph structure

The vault contains these **node types**, connected by `[[wikilinks]]`:

| Node | Directory | Purpose | Audience |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Features** | `features/` | What the system does. High-level functional units. | Claude |
| **Components** | `components/{feature}/` | How pieces work internally. Dense implementation details. | Claude |
| **Concepts** | `concepts/` | Cross-cutting ideas and patterns spanning multiple features. | Claude + Human |
| **Decisions** | `decisions/` | Why things are the way they are — including rejected alternatives. | Claude + Human |
| **Interfaces** | `interfaces/` | Contracts and boundaries between features or packages. | Claude + Human |
| **Guides** | `guides/` | Procedural docs only: build, deploy, test, setup workflows. | Human |
| **Specs** | `specs/` | Machine-readable specifications (OpenAPI, schemas). | Machine |
| **References** | `references/` | Imported pre-existing docs and user-provided materials. | Claude |

**Wikilinks are the edges.** Every note should link to related notes — features link to their components, components link to interfaces they implement, concepts link to the features they span, decisions link to what they affect. This is what makes the vault navigable in Obsidian's graph view.

**Use Mermaid for all diagrams.** More token-efficient than ASCII art, natively rendered by Obsidian, and structured enough to parse and update programmatically. Use it for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state machines, ER diagrams, class diagrams, and dependency graphs. Avoid ASCII art entirely.

**Linking notes in Mermaid diagrams.** To make Mermaid nodes clickable links to other notes, use Obsidian's `internal-link` class — NOT wikilink syntax inside node labels:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Auth Service] --> B[Token Validator]
    B --> C[User Store]
    class A,B,C internal-link;
```

The node label text must match the note filename (without `.md`). Nodes with the `internal-link` class become clickable in Obsidian's reading view. **Never put `[[wikilinks]]` inside Mermaid code blocks** — use wikilinks only in regular markdown content outside of code fences.

**Avoid hex colors in Mermaid.** Do NOT use `classDef` with hex color fills (e.g., `classDef internal fill:#e1f5fe`). Obsidian interprets `#e1f5fe` inside code blocks as an inline hashtag and creates a spurious tag. If you need styling, use named CSS classes without `#` hex values, or skip styling entirely — the diagrams are informational, not decorative.

## Tag taxonomy

Every note gets **three required tags** (applied via the obsidian skill's tag management):

| Category | Tags |
|----------|------|
| **Type** | `doctrack/type/feature`, `component`, `concept`, `decision`, `interface`, `guide`, `reference`, `spec`, `index` |
| **Status** | `doctrack/status/active`, `deprecated`, `draft`, `rejected` |
| **Audience** | `doctrack/audience/claude`, `human`, `machine` |

Additional: `doctrack/project/{name}` (shared vaults), `doctrack/package/{name}` (monorepos).

**Only use tags from the `doctrack/` namespace.** Do not invent domain-specific tags (e.g., `dojo/auth`, `keycloak`, `mongodb`). The tag taxonomy is intentionally controlled — domain-specific context belongs in note content and frontmatter fields, not in tags. Stray tags clutter the tag panel and create inconsistent filtering.

## When to use this

**After making code changes**: Update relevant documentation before finishing your response.

**At session start**: Run session init to orient yourself from previous sessions.

**When the user asks**: Documenting, updating docs, syncing, or generating documentation.

**To initialize a project**: When the user says "doctrack init".

**To refresh stale docs**: When the user says "doctrack refresh", "refresh docs", "update docs", or "sync docs".

**Do NOT use for**: Trivial formatting changes, comment-only edits, or read-only exploration.

## Session init (every session)

Runs at the start of every Claude session in a project with doctrack. Idempotent.

1. **Detect vault and init state**: Check if `.doctrack/` exists on the filesystem.
   - If `.doctrack/` exists but `_project.md` doesn't → post-restart after dependency setup. Tell the user: "Your doctrack vault is set up. Say `doctrack init` to continue."
   - If `_project.md` exists and contains a `Current phase` field that is NOT `complete` → **interrupted init**. Check which phase it's in and summarize progress. Tell the user: "Doctrack init was interrupted during {phase}. Say `doctrack init` to resume where we left off."
   - If `.doctrack/` doesn't exist → check `CLAUDE.md` for vault path info.

2. **Verify MCP connection**: Check if `mcp__obsidian__*` tools are available.
   - If tools are available → try reading `_project.md` via MCP. If it works, proceed to step 3.
   - If tools are available but can't reach the vault → the MCP server may be pointing elsewhere. Check `.mcp.json` to see if it has the right vault path. If not, update it.
   - If tools are NOT available → check if `.mcp.json` exists with an obsidian server config. If not, create it:
     ```json
     {
       "mcpServers": {
         "obsidian": {
           "command": "npx",
           "args": ["@bitbonsai/mcpvault@latest", ".doctrack"]
         }
       }
     }
     ```
     **Use relative paths** (`.doctrack` not absolute) so the config works across clones and users. Claude Code sets the working directory to the project root when spawning MCP servers.
     Tell the user: "I've configured the MCP server in `.mcp.json`. Please restart Claude Code for the connection to activate." Then proceed with what you can do without MCP (read `.doctrack/` files directly from the filesystem using the Read tool as a fallback).

3. **Read project config**: Load `_project.md` from the vault. Check `doctrack_version` (see Version tracking).

4. **Check doctrack-mcp version** (if installed): Run this command (with a timeout to handle old binaries that don't support --version):
   ```bash
   timeout 2 doctrack-mcp --version 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"
   ```
   Expected output format: `doctrack-mcp {version} ({git-hash})`. Compare the version against `0.1.0` (minimum required for this skill version).
   - If not found (`command not found`) and `cargo` is available: run `cargo install --git https://github.com/liamstar97/doctrack.git dt-mcp` and tell the user to restart Claude Code for the MCP server to connect.
   - If output is `unknown` or version is older than required: run `cargo install --git https://github.com/liamstar97/doctrack.git dt-mcp --force` to update. Tell the user "Updated doctrack-mcp — restart Claude Code for the new version to take effect."
   - If `cargo` isn't available: skip silently, the vault works without the MCP server.
   - If up to date: proceed silently.

5. **Orient**: Use vault stats to see recently modified notes. Load only docs relevant to the current task — don't read the whole vault.

## Doctrack refresh

When the user says "doctrack refresh", "refresh docs", "update docs", or "sync docs" — or when you detect that code has changed and docs may be stale. **Requires the doctrack MCP server** (`mcp__doctrack__*` tools).

If doctrack MCP tools are not available, tell the user: "The doctrack MCP server is needed for refresh. Run `cargo install --git https://github.com/liamstar97/doctrack.git dt-mcp` and restart Claude Code."

### Refresh flow

1. **Get the refresh plan**: Call `refresh_docs`. This returns a prioritized list of stale notes with specific reasons (code newer than doc, missing symbols, broken refs).

2. **If nothing is stale**: Report "All documentation is up to date" and stop.

3. **Work through stale notes in priority order** (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW):

   For each stale note:
   a. **Read the note** via obsidian MCP to understand its current content.
   b. **Read the changed code files** listed in the refresh plan reasons. Focus on the symbols and sections that changed.
   c. **Update the note** via obsidian MCP (`patch_note` for surgical edits, `write_note` for significant rewrites):
      - Fix broken file references with correct paths (use `resolve_symbol` if needed)
      - Add documentation for new symbols the note is missing
      - Update descriptions for renamed or modified symbols
      - Fix broken wikilinks
      - Update `last_updated` frontmatter to today's date
   d. **Validate the note**: Call `validate_note` on the updated note. Fix any remaining issues.

4. **Handle undocumented code files**: If `refresh_docs` reported undocumented files:
   - For files that belong to an existing feature, create component notes
   - For files that represent new features, create feature notes
   - Follow the same write-as-you-go pattern from init (write immediately, tag, link)

5. **Verify**: Call `refresh_docs` again. It should return "All documentation is up to date." If issues remain, continue from step 3.

6. **Report**: Tell the user what was updated — e.g., "Updated 5 notes, created 2 new component notes, fixed 3 broken references."

### Incremental refresh (after specific code changes)

When you've just modified code files (not a full refresh), use the targeted workflow instead:

1. Call `check_impact` for each file you changed
2. Read and update only the impacted notes
3. Call `validate_note` on each updated note

This is faster than a full `refresh_docs` when you know exactly what changed.

## Doctrack MCP integration

When the `doctrack` MCP server is available (tools prefixed `mcp__doctrack__`), use it to write better documentation and keep the vault healthy. The MCP server maintains a bidirectional index between code symbols and vault notes.

### Available tools

| Tool | Input | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `validate_note` | `note` (vault-relative path) | Check a note for stale refs, broken wikilinks, ambiguous references |
| `docs_for_file` | `file` (project-relative path) | Find all vault notes that document a code file |
| `resolve_symbol` | `name` (e.g. `SessionManager`) | Look up where a symbol is defined and which notes reference it |
| `check_impact` | `file` (project-relative path) | After code changes, find which vault notes may need updating |
| `refresh_docs` | *(none)* | Scan vault and generate prioritized plan of stale documentation |
| `coverage_report` | *(none)* | Vault health — note count, code files, link coverage, undocumented files |
| `stale_report` | *(none)* | Full list of broken file refs and wikilinks across the vault |
| `search_index` | `query` (keywords) | Fuzzy search across note titles, summaries, tags, and code symbols |

### During code changes

1. **Before modifying code**: Call `docs_for_file` with the file you're about to change. Read the linked vault notes to understand the documented architecture and contracts before making changes.

2. **After modifying code**: Call `check_impact` with the changed file path to see which vault notes reference it. Update those notes if the changes affect documented behavior, renamed symbols, or moved files.

### During documentation writing

1. **Before writing a note**: Call `resolve_symbol` to get accurate file paths and line numbers for symbols you're documenting. Use the resolved paths in `files:` frontmatter and `file-registry` entries — don't guess or abbreviate paths.

2. **After writing or updating a note**: Call `validate_note` with the note path (relative to vault root, e.g. `features/auth.md`). Fix any stale references, ambiguous file refs, or broken wikilinks it reports before moving on.

### Refreshing stale documentation

Call `refresh_docs` to get a prioritized plan of what needs updating. It compares note `last_updated` timestamps against code file modification times, detects new/missing symbols, and finds broken references. Use it:

- **At session start** (after reading `_project.md`) to see what's drifted since last session
- **After a batch of code changes** to identify all impacted docs at once
- **After updating docs** to verify nothing remains stale (idempotent — returns empty when everything is current)

The tool returns a prioritized list (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) with specific reasons per note. Work through them in priority order — HIGH means broken refs or code changed significantly, LOW means minor symbol drift.

### For vault health

- Call `coverage_report` during Phase 4 verification to see overall vault health, undocumented code files, and stale reference counts.
- Call `stale_report` to get the full list of broken references for a cleanup pass.
- Call `search_index` to find existing notes before creating duplicates.

### File path best practices (for MCP indexing)

The MCP server resolves file references in your notes. Help it by:
- **Use full relative paths** in `files:` frontmatter: `custom-actions/src/main/java/com/iointel/ci/actions/Action.java` not `Action.java` or `.../Action.java`
- **Avoid `...` abbreviations** in paths — the indexer can expand them but full paths are more reliable
- **Avoid glob patterns** like `*Exception.java` in file references — they can't be resolved
- **Use backtick code spans** for inline file references: `` `src/auth/session.rs` `` — the indexer extracts these

## Important principles

1. **Read before writing.** Search for existing notes before creating new ones.

2. **Dense internal docs.** Features and components are for Claude — pack them with information.

3. **Document decisions, especially rejections.** The "why not" is as valuable as the "why."

4. **Concepts connect the graph.** When a pattern spans features, create a concept note and link everything to it.

5. **Interfaces define boundaries.** When features communicate, document the contract.

6. **Guides are procedural only.** Build, deploy, test, setup. Not explanations.

7. **Mermaid everywhere.** All diagrams. No ASCII art. Use `class NodeId internal-link;` to make nodes clickable links to notes — never put `[[wikilinks]]` inside Mermaid code blocks.

8. **Incremental updates.** Surgical edits, not full rewrites.

9. **Timestamp everything.** Update `last_updated` on every modification.

10. **Local vault is the default.** `.doctrack/` in the project directory, committed to git.

11. **Wikilinks are edges.** Every cross-reference uses `[[path|Display]]` syntax.

## Version tracking and migration

Current version: `3.0.0`.

### Version history

| Version | Key changes |
|---------|-------------|
| **1.x** | Filesystem-only (`.claude_docs/` + `docs/`). Docs as files in repo. |
| **2.0** | Local Obsidian vault (`.doctrack/`). Knowledge graph (concepts, decisions, interfaces). Mermaid diagrams. Depth-first init. Delegates vault I/O to obsidian skill (mcpvault). |
| **3.0** | Companion `doctrack-mcp` Rust binary. Bidirectional code↔doc index via tree-sitter. MCP tools for validation, impact analysis, coverage, search. Claude Code hooks for proactive feedback. LSP server for editor integration. |

### Version checking (during session init)

After reading `_project.md`, check `doctrack_version`:

1. **Missing** → v1.x filesystem docs. Offer migration.
2. **Matches** → proceed normally.
3. **Same major, older minor** → proceed, silently update version stamp.
4. **Older major** → inform user, offer migration. Don't auto-migrate.
5. **Newer than skill** → warn user, proceed carefully.

### Migration: v1 → v3

When `.claude_docs/` exists but no `.doctrack/`:

1. Read v1 docs (index, features, components — they have structured frontmatter)
2. Create `.doctrack/` vault with `.obsidian/` and `.gitignore`
3. Convert v1 notes to vault notes (convert cross-refs to wikilinks, add tags)
4. Extract implicit concepts and decisions from v1 content
5. Write `_project.md` from v1 index
6. Write `CLAUDE.md` section
7. Ask user: archive or clean up old `.claude_docs/` and `docs/`

### Migration: v2 → v3

When `_project.md` exists with `doctrack_version: "2.x"`:

1. Add `concepts/`, `decisions/`, `interfaces/` directories
2. Move non-procedural guides to `concepts/` or deprecate
3. Convert ASCII art to Mermaid in existing notes
4. Update version stamp
5. If vault is external, offer to move to local `.doctrack/`

## Project initialization

When the user says "doctrack init" or asks to document a project.

### Pre-init

#### Step 1: Install dependencies

**Check for obsidian skill**: Look for `mcp__obsidian__*` tools in the available tools.

If MCP tools are NOT available:
1. Check if `.mcp.json` exists in the project root. If it has an `obsidian` server entry, the MCP server is configured but Claude Code needs a restart.
2. If no `.mcp.json`, check if the obsidian skill is installed by looking for `.claude/skills/obsidian/` or `.agents/skills/obsidian/`.
3. If the obsidian skill is not installed, install it:
   ```bash
   npx skills add bitbonsai/mcpvault --yes
   ```
4. Create or update `.mcp.json` in the project root:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["@bitbonsai/mcpvault@latest", ".doctrack"]
       },
       "doctrack": {
         "command": "doctrack-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   **Always use relative paths** — `.doctrack` not absolute. Claude Code sets the working directory to the project root when spawning MCP servers. `doctrack-mcp` defaults to the current directory when `DOCTRACK_ROOT` is not set. This ensures the config works across clones, worktrees, and users.

   If `.mcp.json` already exists with other servers, merge the entries — don't overwrite existing config. The `doctrack` server is optional — only add it if `doctrack-mcp` is installed (`which doctrack-mcp`). If not installed, skip it and note that the doctrack MCP tools won't be available.
5. Also create the `.doctrack/` directory, `.doctrack/.obsidian/`, and `.doctrack/.gitignore` now — so the vault path in `.mcp.json` is valid when the MCP server starts.
6. **Set up doctrack MCP server**. Check if `doctrack-mcp` is on PATH:
   ```bash
   which doctrack-mcp
   ```
   If not found, try to install it automatically:
   ```bash
   cargo install --git https://github.com/liamstar97/doctrack.git dt-mcp
   ```
   If `cargo` is not available either, tell the user: "Install Rust (https://rustup.rs) and run `cargo install dt-mcp` for code↔doc indexing tools, or skip it — the vault will still work without it." Then remove the `doctrack` entry from `.mcp.json` (only keep `obsidian`).

   Once `doctrack-mcp` is available:
   - The `doctrack` entry in `.mcp.json` (step 4) will work as-is.
   - Install hooks: run `doctrack-mcp --setup-hooks` in the project directory. This adds SessionStart and PostToolUse hooks to `.claude/settings.json` for proactive code↔doc feedback.

7. **STOP and tell the user to restart.** This is critical — you MUST clearly tell the user:

   > "I've set up the doctrack dependencies:
   > - Installed the obsidian skill (mcpvault)
   > - Configured the MCP server(s) in `.mcp.json`
   > - Created the `.doctrack/` vault directory
   > - Installed Claude Code hooks (if doctrack-mcp is available)
   >
   > **Please restart Claude Code** (exit and relaunch), then say `doctrack init` again. The MCP server needs a restart to connect to the vault."

   After delivering this message, **do not continue with init**. Do not attempt to write vault notes, create features, or do any documentation work. The MCP connection will not be available until after the restart. End your response here.

If MCP tools ARE available → proceed to step 2.

#### Step 2: Create local vault

- Create `.doctrack/` directory on the filesystem
- Create `.doctrack/.obsidian/` for Obsidian config
- Write `.doctrack/.gitignore`:
  ```
  .obsidian/workspace.json
  .obsidian/workspace-mobile.json
  .obsidian/appearance.json
  .obsidian/hotkeys.json
  .obsidian/app.json
  .obsidian/graph.json
  ```
- Verify MCP can reach the vault: try a simple `get_vault_stats` call. If it fails, the MCP server may be pointed at a different path — update `.mcp.json` and tell the user to restart.
- Open the vault in Obsidian via the obsidian skill's CLI: `obsidian open path="{absolute-path}/.doctrack"`. If Obsidian CLI isn't available, tell the user: "Open `.doctrack/` as a vault in Obsidian to browse the knowledge graph."

#### Step 3: Detect project name

From `package.json` `name` field, directory name, or ask the user.

#### Step 4: Check for existing doctrack data

- `.claude_docs/` on filesystem → v1, offer migration (see Version tracking)
- `_project.md` in vault → already initialized, ask to re-init or abort

#### Step 5: Check for monorepo

Check for any of these indicators:
- **JS/TS**: `workspaces` in `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `lerna.json`, `turbo.json`, `nx.json`
- **Java/Kotlin**: `<modules>` section in `pom.xml` (Maven multi-module), `include` in `settings.gradle` or `settings.gradle.kts` (Gradle multi-project)
- **Rust**: `[workspace]` in root `Cargo.toml`
- **Go**: Multiple `go.mod` files in subdirectories
- **Git**: `.gitmodules` file (git submodules)
- **General**: `packages/`, `apps/`, `services/`, or `libs/` directories containing multiple sub-projects with their own build configs
- **Multi-platform**: Multiple independent sub-projects with their own `.git` directories under one parent

### Init strategy: depth-first, write-as-you-go, resumable

Doctrack uses a **depth-first** approach with **immediate writes** and **checkpoint tracking**. This is critical for large projects where sessions may be interrupted by usage limits, timeouts, or restarts.

**Core principles:**
- Process one module at a time in depth, not all modules broadly
- Write each note to the vault **immediately** after creating it — don't batch writes
- Checkpoint progress in `_project.md` after each module completes
- On resume, detect what's already documented and continue where you left off

### Phase 1: Lightweight discovery

Read **only build config and directory structure** — do not read source files yet.

1. **Read build config** — `pom.xml`, `package.json`, `build.gradle`, `Cargo.toml`, etc. Identify modules/packages and their dependencies.
2. **List modules** — from build config or top-level directories. For each module, note: name, path, estimated size (file count via glob).
3. **Import existing docs** — this step is important, don't skip it. Search the project for:
   - `README.md` at root and in each module
   - `CLAUDE.md` with project context
   - `docs/`, `documentation/`, `wiki/` directories
   - Architecture decision records (`adr/`, `decisions/`)
   - API specs, design docs, runbooks, `.md` files in non-source directories

   For each found doc, **copy the full content verbatim** into `references/imported/{filename}.md` in the vault. Add frontmatter with `original_path` and `type: reference` at the top, but preserve the entire original document body below the frontmatter — do NOT summarize, truncate, or paraphrase. Tag with `doctrack/type/reference`. These are valuable source material — they often contain architectural context, decisions, and domain knowledge not visible in code.

   Ask user about archiving filesystem copies to `.doctrack/archive/`.
4. **Sort modules by dependency order** — foundation/shared modules first. If unclear, smallest first.
5. **Write initial `_project.md`** — module list with a `Status` column tracking init progress:

```markdown
## Init Progress

Current phase: **phase-1**

### Modules

| Module | Files | Status | Components |
|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| ci-model | 43 | pending | — |
| ci-common | 11 | pending | — |
| story-service | 300 | pending | — |

### Phase 3 Checklist

| Category | Target | Created | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Concepts | 6-10 | 0 | pending |
| Decisions | 5-8 | 0 | pending |
| Interfaces | 4-8 | 0 | pending |
| References | all docs | 0 | pending |
| README | — | — | pending |
| CLAUDE.md | — | — | pending |
| Guides | — | — | pending |
```

This is the **checkpoint**. It tracks progress across ALL phases:

- **`Current phase`** — which phase the init is in (`phase-1`, `phase-2`, `phase-3`, `phase-4`, `complete`). Updated when transitioning between phases.
- **Modules table** — Phase 2 progress. Update each module to `done` with component count after completing it.
- **Phase 3 Checklist** — tracks cross-cutting note creation. Update `Created` count and `Status` after writing each category. This prevents Phase 3 from re-running on resume if it already completed.

On resume, read this checkpoint to determine:
1. Which phase to start from
2. Which modules still need documenting (Phase 2)
3. Which Phase 3 categories still need work

### Phase 2: Deep-dive modules (depth-first, write-as-you-go)

Process modules **one at a time** (or 2-3 independent modules in parallel). For each module, follow this sequence — **writing each note immediately, not batching**:

**Step A: Read source files** for this module in small groups (5-10 files at a time for large modules). As you read each group, identify what component it belongs to.

**Step B: Write the feature note immediately.** Don't wait until you've read all files — write a draft feature note after reading enough to understand the architecture (first 10-15 files). You can patch it later with additional details. Getting the note into the vault early means it survives interruption.

**Step C: Write each component note as you identify it.** This is the critical change from batch writing: as soon as you understand a logical unit (a controller, a service, a model group), write its component note immediately. Then move to the next group of source files. This way, if the session ends mid-module, the components you've already written are preserved.

**Component notes are not optional.** Guidelines:

| Module size | Expected components |
|------------|-------------------|
| 1-2 files | 0 (feature note is sufficient) |
| 3-10 files | 2-5 components |
| 10-30 files | 5-15 components |
| 30-100 files | 15-30 components |
| 100+ files | 30+ components |

**Step D: Tag each note immediately after writing it.** Don't defer tagging to a batch step.

**Step E: Checkpoint.** After finishing a module (feature + all components), update `_project.md` via `patch_note`:
- Set `Current phase` to `phase-2` (if not already)
- Set this module's row in the Modules table to `done` with component count
- Add file registry entries for this module (individual source files)
- This is the checkpoint — if the session ends here, the next session knows this module is complete

**Step F: Note cross-cutting observations** as you go — shared patterns, architectural choices, contracts. Collect these for Phase 3 but don't write them yet.

**Step G: Move to the next module.**

**Parallelization**: Spawn subagents for 2-3 independent modules at a time — but each subagent must follow the write-as-you-go pattern internally. Don't spawn all modules in parallel.

Give each subagent this context:
```
You are documenting the "{module-name}" module for doctrack. Go DEEP.

Module path: {path}
Source files: {count} files
Module dependencies: {list of other modules this depends on}
Already-documented modules (for cross-referencing): {list with vault paths}

CRITICAL: Write each note IMMEDIATELY after creating it — do NOT batch writes.
The session may end at any time due to usage limits. Every note you write to
the vault before that happens is preserved. Every note you defer is lost.

Workflow:
1. Read source files in groups of 5-10
2. Write features/{module-name}.md as soon as you understand the architecture
3. Write components/{module-name}/{component}.md ONE AT A TIME as you identify each
4. Tag each note immediately after writing
5. Return: vault paths created + file registry entries (individual files)

A module with {count} files should produce roughly {count/5 to count/3} components.
Use internal-link class in Mermaid nodes. Use [[wikilinks]] in markdown content only.
Do NOT use classDef with hex colors (#e1f5fe etc.) — Obsidian creates spurious tags.
Vault paths must be clean note paths (e.g., features/auth.md, components/auth/token.md).
Never write notes with paths containing wildcards, code patterns, or Java package names.
```

### Phase 3: Build cross-cutting knowledge graph

Update `Current phase` to `phase-3` in `_project.md` before starting.

After all modules are documented (or as many as completed before interruption), this phase is equally important as Phase 2 — it's what turns isolated feature docs into a connected knowledge graph. Don't rush or skip it.

**Write each note immediately** (same write-as-you-go principle as Phase 2). **Checkpoint after each sub-phase** by updating the Phase 3 Checklist in `_project.md`.

#### 3a. Concept notes

Create concept notes for every cross-cutting pattern that spans 2+ modules. Review the features you documented — what patterns appeared repeatedly?

**Minimum guideline**: A project with N modules should have roughly N/3 to N/2 concept notes. An 18-module project should produce 6-10 concepts.

Common concepts to look for:
- Shared architectural patterns (event-driven messaging, circuit breaker, audit logging)
- Domain models that cross module boundaries
- Infrastructure patterns (service discovery, config management, security model)
- Data flow patterns (ingestion pipeline, processing pipeline)
- Operational patterns (monitoring, logging, deployment)

**Checkpoint**: After writing all concept notes, update the Phase 3 Checklist in `_project.md`: set Concepts row to `Created: {count}`, `Status: done`.

#### 3b. Decision notes

Create decision notes for every non-trivial architectural choice visible in the codebase. Look for:
- Technology choices (why this database? why this messaging system? why this framework?)
- Architectural patterns (why microservices? why event-driven? why this module structure?)
- Design tradeoffs visible in code comments, README, or existing docs
- Conventions that aren't obvious (why denormalized data? why this naming pattern?)

**Minimum guideline**: A project with N modules should have roughly N/3 decision notes. An 18-module project should produce 5-8 decisions. Each should include rejected alternatives.

**Checkpoint**: Update Decisions row in Phase 3 Checklist to `done` with count.

#### 3c. Interface notes

Create interface notes for every contract between modules. Look for:
- Shared DTOs/models passed between services
- REST API contracts between services (Feign clients, HTTP endpoints)
- Message schemas (Kafka topics, event formats)
- Database document schemas shared across modules
- Plugin/extension interfaces

**Minimum guideline**: A project with inter-service communication should have at least one interface per communication channel. An 18-module microservices project should produce 4-8 interface notes.

**Checkpoint**: Update Interfaces row in Phase 3 Checklist to `done` with count.

#### 3d. Import references

Import any pre-existing documentation that wasn't captured in Phase 1:
- README files from modules
- Existing docs/, wiki/, or documentation directories
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- API specs, design docs, runbooks
- CLAUDE.md files with project context

**Copy the full content verbatim** into `references/imported/{filename}.md` in the vault — add frontmatter but do NOT summarize, truncate, or paraphrase the original content. Tag with `doctrack/type/reference`.

**Checkpoint**: Update References row in Phase 3 Checklist to `done` with count.

#### 3e. Finalize project files and config

Write filesystem files and finalize the vault:
5. **Write `README.md`** on filesystem.
6. **Write `CLAUDE.md`** on filesystem (idempotent — read existing first, update the `# Doctrack` section in place or append if not present):

```markdown
# Doctrack

This project maintains a knowledge graph in `.doctrack/` (Obsidian vault).

## BEFORE writing any code

You MUST read relevant documentation before planning or implementing changes:

1. Read `.doctrack/_project.md` for project structure and module map
2. Search the vault for features related to the code you'll touch:
   - Use `mcp__obsidian__search_notes` with the module/feature name
   - Read the matching feature note and its component notes
3. Check `concepts/` for cross-cutting patterns that may affect your approach
4. Check `decisions/` for past choices and rejected alternatives — do NOT re-propose
   approaches that were already considered and rejected

This context prevents duplicate work, respects architectural decisions, and ensures
your changes align with existing patterns.

## AFTER modifying code files

You MUST update the knowledge graph to reflect your changes:

1. Update the feature note if the feature's architecture, dependencies, or API changed
2. Update or create component notes for any classes/modules you modified or added
3. Create a decision note if you made a non-trivial design choice — include
   alternatives you considered and why you rejected them
4. Update interfaces if contracts between modules changed
5. Create a concept note if you introduced a new cross-cutting pattern
6. Update `_project.md` file registry if you added new source files

Do NOT skip documentation updates. The knowledge graph is how future sessions
understand this codebase without re-reading source files.

## Vault connection

- Vault path: `.doctrack/`
- MCP servers: configured in `.mcp.json` (obsidian server for vault I/O, doctrack server for code↔doc index)
- If MCP tools are unavailable: read/write `.doctrack/` files directly from filesystem
```

7. **Write hooks** to `.claude/settings.json` (idempotent — read existing, merge, don't overwrite other settings):

Read the project's `.claude/settings.json` if it exists. Add or update hook entries. Preserve any existing hooks and settings.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "test -f .doctrack/_project.md && echo 'Doctrack vault detected at .doctrack/. Read _project.md and relevant feature/component notes before starting work. Check decisions/ for past architectural choices.' || true",
            "statusMessage": "Checking for doctrack..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If `doctrack-mcp` is installed (check with `which doctrack-mcp`), also install hooks for proactive code↔doc feedback by running:

```bash
doctrack-mcp --setup-hooks
```

This merges hooks into `.claude/settings.json` without overwriting existing settings:
- **SessionStart**: shows vault coverage summary at the start of each session
- **PostToolUse**: validates notes after writing them via obsidian MCP tools

If `.claude/settings.json` already has other hooks, the doctrack hooks are appended alongside them.

8. **Write procedural guides** — `guides/development.md`, `guides/deployment.md` if applicable.
9. **Write specs** — `specs/openapi.md` if REST APIs exist.

### Phase 4: Verify completeness

Update `Current phase` to `phase-4` in `_project.md`.

1. **Cross-reference pass** — check wikilinks in Dependencies, Relationships, concept links, interface implementors. Fill gaps.
2. **File registry audit** — compare source files against registry. Unmapped files → missed components.
3. **Component coverage check** — flag modules where file count vs component count suggests gaps.
4. **Graph density check** — report: total wikilinks, links per note, orphan notes (should be 0), cross-type links (links between different node types like feature→concept). A healthy vault has 3+ links per note and zero orphans.
5. **Tag audit** — verify all notes have the required doctrack/ tags (type + status + audience). Flag any non-doctrack tags.
6. **Set `Current phase` to `complete`** — remove the Init Progress section from `_project.md` or keep it as a record. The init is done.

### Resuming an interrupted init

When session init detects an Init Progress section in `_project.md`, read the `Current phase` and checklist to determine where to resume:

**If `Current phase` is `phase-1`**: Phase 1 is lightweight — just re-run it.

**If `Current phase` is `phase-2`**:
1. Tell the user: "Resuming doctrack init — {N} of {M} modules documented so far. Continuing with {next pending module}..."
2. Process only modules with `pending` status.
3. Check `done` modules for component coverage — flag any with suspiciously low counts (e.g., 50 files but 0 components) for re-documentation.
4. After all modules complete, proceed to Phase 3.

**If `Current phase` is `phase-3`**:
1. Tell the user: "Resuming doctrack init — modules are done, continuing with knowledge graph ({list pending categories})..."
2. Read the Phase 3 Checklist. Only run sub-phases still marked `pending` (e.g., if Concepts is `done` but Decisions is `pending`, start from 3b).
3. After Phase 3 completes, proceed to Phase 4.

**If `Current phase` is `phase-4`**: Tell the user "Resuming — running verification pass." Re-run verification.

**If `Current phase` is `complete`**: Init is already done. Tell the user: "This project is already initialized. To re-initialize from scratch, delete `.doctrack/` and run `doctrack init` again."

This means large projects can be initialized across **multiple sessions** — each session makes progress, checkpoints it, and the next session picks up exactly where it left off.

### Init for monorepos

**Detection**: Same indicators as Step 5 of Pre-init — JS workspaces, Maven `<modules>`, Gradle `include`, Cargo `[workspace]`, `.gitmodules`, multiple `go.mod`, or multi-project directory structures.

**Workflow** (same depth-first strategy, scoped to packages):
1. Lightweight discovery — detect packages, list them, sort by dependency order
2. Write root `_project.md` with Mermaid cross-package diagram and Init Progress table
3. Deep-dive each package (Phase 2 within `packages/{name}/`) — process 2-3 at a time, write-as-you-go
4. After all packages: create monorepo-level concepts, decisions, interfaces
5. Write root README and CLAUDE.md
6. Cross-reference pass across packages
7. Tag with `doctrack/package/{name}`

---

## Working with teams

All agents share the same vault via git. For concurrent access (multiple agents, worktrees):

- **Scope-based partitioning**: Each agent only updates notes for features it modifies.
- **Append-only for project config**: Use append mode for `_project.md` during concurrent work.
- **Advisory locking**: Check `editing_agent` frontmatter before updating shared notes.
- **Post-task reconciliation**: Consolidate appends, check for stale notes, clear locks, verify file registry.

For vault backup and git sync, use the obsidian skill's git sync capabilities.

## Naming conventions

- **Features**: kebab-case (`user-authentication.md`)
- **Components**: kebab-case (`token-validator.md`)
- **Concepts**: descriptive kebab-case (`health-data-model.md`)
- **Decisions**: verb-prefixed kebab-case (`chose-firestore.md`, `rejected-websockets.md`)
- **Interfaces**: kebab-case (`health-data-schema.md`)
